Friendly and relaxing,"We stayed in Tryfan Cottage, Red Dragon Holidays, Beddgelert for a super relaxing weekend. It was a great location with outstanding views looking out to a gorgeous forest and a 200 year old tree. This traditional cottage had everything our family needed for a lovely break. The owner was informal and informative and went out of his way to make our stay stress free.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Short and sweet stay,"Arrived late on the Friday night & had no issues with finding the pod and getting settled right away. 
The pod was lit up and warm waiting for our arrival. Anthony came to greet us and provided us with some local knowledge. 
The pod was as expected & came with a heater which was needed in this cold weather! The bathrooms were better than basic, warm hot showers in their own bathroom space with toilet and sink.
Would definitely stay again.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR

Spectacular Snowdon with comfort,"This was my 4th visit to Red Dragon. Think that says it all really. It's a place you just can't keep from coming back. Stayed in Arran cottage this time, but have stayed in Snowdon too. 
The beds are lush with duvets you can get lost in. 
For this type of quailty, location and friendly accommodation, I have yet to find anything cheaper. 
This place should be kept a secret (sssshhh).
Did some great hiking on this trip. The location is so perfect, only 300m from the Watkin path. 
On this trip we went up the Pyg track and came down Watkins, then tried out the great pubs in Beddgelert. 
Also the perfect start for the Fisherman's path through Beddgelert. 
Went for a sunrise hike which looped back in time for a magnificient Welsh breakfast at the nearby Nant Gwynant cafe.
Fab place to stay. Already planning my next visit",5,,,,,,,OR

Red dragon’s a winner,"My son and I stayed in the middle of November. The location is fabulous, a five minute walk to the beginning of the Watkins path at the base of Snowdon. The pods themselves are great, and cope with all the weather that the late Welsh autumn threw at us (and boy did it rain!) Electricity points, a heater, kettle etc, and enough room for a serious board game evening, we would definitely consider staying again.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Great location to meet up with a group of friends,"We’ve had a fantastic meet up weekend with uni friends, hosted by Tony. We stayed in the cottage called Aran - great space for us all to meet, share food etc. Others stayed in other cottages and pods. Clean, comfortable, plenty of space. Great location for outdoor activities - some climbed and others walked. Next year some of us may even swim in the local lake. Great views and the Watkins path is in easy reach too. Cafe Gwynant does a good breakfast.
We will definitely be back next year!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Had a great time!,"Amazing location! If you are looking for a nature escape, this is the place to book. Staff are exceptional and always ready to help. My brother and dad had a great time exploring the surrounding area. Also amazing if you are looking to hike up Snowdon.",5,,,,,,,OR
Our Great Snowdon Adventure.,"Stayed in a pod here when we went on a company charity hike up Snowdon, It was great to actually meet Anthony and for him to be on site when we arrived and available thereafter. The pod i Stayed in with my husband was the one closest to the road and whilst the traffic could be heard through the pod it really didn't bother us. the pods are basic but clean they have plenty of plug sockets to use too. The shared bathrooms were clean and had what you needed.
As a collective we hired pods and the lodge for the weekend, I did slip on the decking outside the lodge which wasn't ideal, and so would recommend people take extra care on the decking, but whilst a shock to the system this had no poor bearing on our stay.
Whilst we didn't take our dog, the pods are dog friendly and so I can imagine this to be a lovely little safe place for your dog.
The heater in the pod was very effective it warmed the pod a treat and the lighting was very good also.
Thank you!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Great location at the base of Snowdonia and perfect for a group getaway,"As a returning guest, I was very happy to recommend and take my work colleagues to the Red Dragon Holidays as a perfect accommodation base for our company Dawsons charity hike up Snowdon in September 2023.
As always, we had a lovely warm welcome from the owner Anthony who was equipped to be on hand for our needs. Before our Red Dragon trip, Anthony was always at the other end of the phone should we have any queries up until arrival with the 13 of us.
We booked 4 pods, the Dragons Lair and Dragons Den which was a perfect opportunity to host our large group.
A massive thank you to Anthony and I look forward to booking my next stay.",5,,,,,,,OR
3 nights in the Dragon's Lair,"Even before arriving I rang beforehand to add wifi for our room. I would definitely recommend doing this, as its fairly cheap and it allowed us to contact family and get directions, as it was stated that there would be no signal. The owner, Anthony, was very helpful and gave me an abundance of information on the area and info regarding climbing Snowdon (the location of this pod is amazing if you want to climb Snowdon)
My two friends and I arrived at Bryn Dinas camping pods after having previously stayed for a night in Dolgellau. We booked the Dragons Lair. I was shocked at first to see that it was situated on the side of the road, however it did look very inviting. We parked on the side of the road, close to enternace, not too far to take our belongings.
We were delighted with our accommodation and it was perfect for the three of us. It had four bunk beds with bedding, toilet and shower (very warm and powerful), microwave, kettle, hairdryer, and tea and coffee making facilities. It was small and compact but plenty of room for all of our things. The little heater in the room was an added bonus and the bedding was so thick and cozy, we never felt cold despite being in the woods.
Although our room didn't have any other kitchen facilities, there was a shared hut that had a toaster, another microwave, fridge, and washing facilties. The shared fridge was helpful as we could store milk and yogurt etc.
There was also a laundrette room, which we thought was handy.
The fairy lights were very sweet in the evening and there was a place at the bottom of the camp where we could set up our little travel gas stove, so we were able to make some pasta and toast marshmallows.
We saw Anthony who again was very kind and very welcoming, offering more advice and couldn't be more happy to help us. We definitely recommend. Very clean and compact. Loved every minute. Check our Cafi Gwynant, 1 minuite walk from the camp, they serve fab coffee!!",5,,,,,,,OR

40th birthday with 20 friends! Amazing!,"I arranged a weekend break to celebrate my partners 40th birthday with our friends. There were 20 of us so we rented out Arran and Maple cottage as well as 3 pods! The cottages were great, had everything you could want, comfy beds and plenty of space to sit and socialise.
The pods came with their individual bathroom located in the shower block - toilet, shower and sink.
We were the for 3 days and wanted to stay longer!
Antony was a great communicator ensuring we were all set and ready and we were greeted by Angela who stayed on until we got there to ensure we had everything we needed. The gave us another bbq as well which was really kind!
This is a great place for climbing Snowdon! Would highly recommend and we will be back!
Something small to improve on, it would have been nice to have salt, pepper and some olive oil to cook with.
Amazing stay! Thanks so much!! Xx",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Bryn Dina’s Camping Pods- Amazing!,"I loved staying at Bryn Dinas Camping Pods.
The pod itself was even better then expected, bathroom incredibly clean & they provide cleaning products / towels to dry the items used down after so it stays clean for other guests.
We were fortunate enough to have our own bathroom as our neighbouring pod was empty. But with the items supplied, it wouldn’t have bothered me to share! Lovely hot shower.
So peaceful, easy to park outside (it was quiet when we stayed but there is parking around the area too). Benches to sit & eat outside.
A little table and two chairs outside of our cabin for a more private dinner if you wanted.
Heater was very warm, so great for winter! Big windows for air circulation also in our cabin.
We will be rebooking shortly to come back in the Summer & hike Snowdon.
It’s also located right near a path entrance & we took this all the way to the local village. Beautiful walk & stunning scenery.
If you’re a fan of outdoor swimming, take your swim wear as the lake a stone throw away is to good to miss!
Couldn’t of asked for a nicer stay. Hosts were very informative when we booked, lots of ideas and facts about area.
Contacted us 24 hours before & on the day regarding the self check in procedure.
If you’re looking for a quiet & private get away, I couldn’t recommend it more.
See you again Bryn Dinas!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Great Location for a Snowdon Hike.,"I would strongly recommend Bryn Dinas to anyone visiting the Snowdon area. My friends and I stayed 2 nights and found Anthony to be friendly and very accommodating. 
We were very happy with the pod/facilities which were affordable, clean, warm and perfect for our needs with a great view from the site. 
You could hear the nearby river and feel immersed in nature as the site is quiet with little passing traffic. 
Although the traffic is minimal it is quite a fast road and would not let kids or dogs roam too freely. 
Prime location for access to the Watkin Path and Pools. Lovely cafe walking distance from pods and Watkins walk start point. 
Beddgelert not too far and you can walk on the lakeside into the town however we drove as had a hard walk already!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Stunning location with comfortable and affordable accomodation,"The dragons den had everything we could need, it was clean ans warm ans staff were very helpful.

Central Snowdonia location with all the comforts a family needs,"This was our 2nd trip to Red Dragon after staying in Snowdon cottage last year. This time we were a slightly larger group so stayed in Aran cottage.
The cottage has just had a new double cooker installed which was great for our early morning breakfasts. It wasn’t easy getting the teenagers up as they were addicted to their lush feather down quilts and pillows. On an evening the log fire was great and the vast choice of boardgames meant that the TV wasn’t even turned on once.
We had a small dog with us this time, which meant some of our big adventures were restricted. However, we were still able to take him down the Sygun Copper mine just round the corner. The walk around Llyn Dinas was fab since it is in the middle of lambing season and there were new born lambs everywhere. We also had a trip out to Harlech beach which was lovely with big sand dunes and a wide open beach area with golden sands.
There is so much to do and explore here that we didn’t have time for everything. It’s safe to say we’ll be back, especially as location is central to everything in Snowdonia and North Wales. The price cannot be beaten for this type of cottage in Snowdonia, especially in high season.",5,,,,,,,OR
Sister get away,"Me and my sister had a 5 night get away. 
We stayed in the maple lodge cabin and absolutely loved it.
 Anthony Was really welcoming and gave us lots of things we could do and walks around the area.

Friendly Warm & Welcoming,"We stayed in the Beaumaris Castle Pod. The site has 24 hour access, ideal for long distance travellers.

There are several types of accommodation to suit all types of travellers. 
The accommodation is very clean and suitable for all-year visits; the proprietors kindly left the heater and bedside lamp on for our arrival, which was gave us a perfectly cosy welcome in November.
The booking was online and confirmation email very detailed and precise, containing all of the information needed.
There are tea and coffee making facilities in the pod and several plug sockets. There is also a small kitchen area on site and a drying room with washing machines and tumble dryers; ideal for the seasoned winter walkers. The shower rooms are very clean, tidy and well-considered.
The website contains a wealth of information and links to activities, walks and things to do. 
The site is less than half a mile from the Watkin path up Snowden and located next to woodland with stunning views across valleys.
Tony and Angela were wonderfully friendly, helpful and accommodating. They greeted us on arrival and happily took the time to show us around. We had a wonderful experience and will be back!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Cosy log cabin! Brilliant for families,"A fabulous, cosy weekend spent at the Maple Lodge log cabin at Red Dragon holidays. 
Perfect base for a family of 4 - cosy double bed and a mezzanine floor that sleeps two that we could not get the kids out of! We had a lovely warm stay, with homely comforts at hand.

A dream location,"Marvellous location and a site that appears to cater for almost everyone. I stayed in Snowden cottage which had all the home comforts and mod cons. The cottages are beautifully furnished and cosy (I asked if I could look around as I’m planning a big birthday event soon). The lodges looked great and the pods looked fab too. Must try these next time.
This is a wonderful place to stay, particularly if you love nature and the great outdoors. I’m already planning my next trip and aim to bring family and friends next time. I’m already planning for my big birthday too as this place will be perfect for all ages.

No phone connection here but the pods offer Wi-Fi £2.50 day",5,,,,,,,OR
Saved my weekend,"Travelled to climb Snowdon and of all things forgot to pack my tent, I tried several places for accommodation with no luck.
 Phoned the Red Dragon and explained my circumstances, the owner was brilliant and prepared a Pod in quick time after the previous owners vacated, I arrived around 1900hrs not really knowing what I was getting.
The Pod was immaculate and comfortable, the bathroom block (which is no more than 10 metres from any Pod) was also immaculate and the showers are awesome, laundry room, kitchen area etc all clean and tidy. Couldn’t believe my luck as it’s literally a 5 min walk to start the Watkins route to Snowdon passing the beautiful waterfalls. Both lakes are a stones throw for Kayaking too.
Had the best two nights sleep and if you ever fancy a night/week in a Pod I’d strongly recommend the Red Dragon. Beautiful area to explore. Thank you, Colin",5,,,,,,,OR
Lush time away,"Just home after a wonderful weekend away in the camping pods.
 Had such a fantastic time that we didn’t want to come home. 
It’s a perfect base with so many adventures to be had that we cannot wait to return soon.

Red dragon in the heart of snowdonia,"Stayed here for 4 nights in a 2 bed cottage which is in the heart of snowdonia, location was great it was central to lots of walks, lakes, places if interest. My husband and 2 boys had a wonderful time being able to get to many places withing 30min drive or just simply walk there's a beautiful waterfall you can walk straight from the house to which also leads to the start of the summit. 
Incredible views on the way here and lovely walking routes all around, the village of beddgelert was a about 5min drive were theres resturants, pubs, icecream shop and small convenience store, plus stunning views and rivers plus the people were all so very friendly, would deffo go back.",5,,,,,,,OR
Very comfortable and a great location,"My group stayed for 3 nights in the camping pods, which were very clean and comfortable. The location of the pods were perfect for us with the local shop only a 5 minutes drive away and a number of pubs and cafe’s only a short drive away. The site was only a 5 minute walk from the start of the Watkin path which is the route we used to climb snowdon, this was great as we were able to park and leave our cars by the pods avoiding paying for parking elsewhere. The scenery surrounding the pods is beautiful with 2 huge lakes within walking distance; given the weather was quite hot these provided an amazing opportunity for a swim to cool down. The facilities were good and gave us everything we needed for our stay, although the kitchenette fridge was a little small so was full most of the time. The bathrooms were good and kept relatively clean. There is a seating area with a BBQ and fire pit which was great of an evening for my group to sit outside, although I would recommend taking your own BBQ/ stove in case they are in use. Would definitely stay here again!",5,,,,,,,OR
Camping pods,"Beautiful setting ,quiet,clean, every thing you need
We loved our stay
Owner very helpful dog friendly we was very lucky with the weather, cooking facilities showers very clean
We will definitely be back",5,,,,,,,OR
Very nice!,"
I stayed here with a group of couples recently and I'd reccomend this site. Each pod has a designated bathroom (shower, loo, sink, heated towels rack, loo roll, shampoo and conditioner!) Which are very well kept and pleasant. You share these with one other cabin. The pods themselves are very nice, warm and have electric sockets (there is a kettle and teas too as well as a heater and matress and pillow provided). I stayed in pod number one at the back and I really liked it. The whole place had a friendly atmosphere, nice helpful staff and I know my friends enjoyed it too. The only downside really is the road can be noisy when busy, but very peaceful otherwise and very close to attractions such as the watkin path and snowdonia. I'd visit again 😁",5,,,,,,,OR

 Shared wash up, fridge, microwave and toaster are handy too. Perfectly located for Snowdon at the start of the Watkin Path and close to some lovely waterfalls/pools to cool down in. Two nearby lakes for watersports with hire available. No phone signal, as there is a mountain in the way, so worth paying for the excellent Wifi.",5,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,OR

"Cozy camping pod, perfect for two!","Me and my husband made a very last minute decision to climb Snowdonia on our short holiday so we booked the camping pod for 2 nights without much research on the routes to Snowdonia. Lucky for us, this site is only 5 minutes walk from the entrance of the Watkins path which is one of the paths with most beautiful views and waterfalls...mind you, it is also one of the hardest. There is also a viewpoint 10 mins drive from the site and also a lake nearby. There is also a popular cafe within 5 mins walk near the Watkins path entrance.
The pod is perfect for two and very cozy with a heater which was very useful as it was cold in the morning and at night outside.
We were allocated a bathroom and it was clean with toilet papers and hand wash provided. The kitchenette also had dishwashing liquid with sponge and kitchen towel.
Make sure you get the WiFi if you need it because we didn't have any network in the area.",5,,,,,,,OR
Amazing holiday,"The camping pod experience at Red Dragon Bryn Dinas was just outstanding. From arrival everything was ready to go and the process was very simple. The views from the Camping pods were stunning. All you can see is winding country lanes, fields and mountain views in every direction. Within about a ten minute drive you can find a small village with nice shops, cafes and pubs. As well as this there are plenty of activities very close by. This includes multiple walking trails up Snowdon, even in the winter months this is great to do, mountain biking, walking. As well as this close by there are a lot of adventurous activities to do, the worlds longest zip line, white water rafting to name a couple. As well as all of this the camping pods themselves were extremely clean, warm and nice, the shower and bathroom facilities were also well maintained and clean. The only bad part about the
Trip was the drive home, although we spent this planning our next trip to the camping pods.",5,,,,,,,OR
Brilliant base camp for the hills,"Just back from a very wet and windy (and a bit snowy) trip to Snowdonia, staying at Bryn Dinas camping pods.
My pod was warm, dry and spotlessly clean. Couldn’t have asked for more really. Personal bathroom provided due to covid precautions which was also kept spotlessly clean. Shower was roasting hot which is just what I needed after a couple of big days on the hill.
This place is a perfect location for exploring all that the park has to offer. Within a 5 minute walk of the Bethania car park and the start of the Watkin path up Snowdon.
I will definitely return!",5,,,,,,,OR
Good Find!,"Brilliant Stay! We stayed in Conwy Castle Pod.
Slept well every night, clean facilities. Little radiator to hear the pod so it’s not cold!
Easy to find considering there’s zero signal around there. Option of WIFI Extra there if required.
Right at the South Bottom of Snowdon near Watkins Path a couple minutes walk up the road (Very Difficult Path-Would not use if it’s your first time!)
Would definitely use again",5,,,,,,,OR
Excellent Snowdon Base,"A little nervous in booking a log cabin, especially when the forecast for our stay was horrendous but we really shouldn’t have been. 
Dragon’s Den was very cozy and extremely warm, was incredibly well equipped with everything we could possibly need and perfect for relaxing after long wet days in the mountains. 
On demand hot water, great heating, really comfy beds, plenty of bedding and enough hooks to hang at least 3 sets of wet clothes to dry including coats. Will 100% return and would recommend to anyone.",5,,,,,,,OR
Love staying here. Totally recommend.,"Have stayed here twice before. The weather wasn’t good but love staying at our ‘bed in a shed’!! The pod was warm, the beds comfy. 
The staff are so friendly, got lots of resilience communication, if I had a query it was answered quickly and efficiently. 
Used the microwave for dinner at night, used washing up area. 
Wished lights stayed on longer outside that hut but it’s ok. Shower block is clean, the shower was fab and hot and powerful. 
The place is very Covid safe, you have a bathroom allocated to your pod and one other. Annoyingly some people staying in the bigger pods didn’t stick to this and used our bathroom frequently, meaning we had to use other bathrooms. 
Not good but understand this is impossible to police. Just a shame other people not respectful of the situation.

Red Dragon PODs are perfect for s short break,"I wasn't aware but the pods are situated right at the entrance of Walker Path up Snowdon which I believe is the best path to take although it is the 2nd hardest, views are stunning.
 PODs are ideal with clean toilets and shower facilities and kitchen has microwave and fridge and laundrette. Had a nice BBQ outside and the views are stunning",5,,,,4.0,,4.0,OR
Perfect pod for a solo trip,"I stayed for two nights at Bryn Dinas Camping Pods and was really impressed with the location and the facilities.
 Bathrooms were lovely and there was plenty of space to cook outside.
 The pods were within walking distance of two beautiful lakes and the start of the Watkins Path up to Snowdon. 
Also only a 5k walk to Beddgelert along a lovely footpath. Will definitely stay again on my next visit to North Wales. I would recommend insect repellent though!!",5,,,,,,,OR
Fantastic spot,"We spent a lovely 3 nights at Bryn Dinas Camping Pods.
 It was easy to get to and in a fab location with beautiful walks from the doorstep, including the Watkin Path up to Snowdon. 
Gorgeous lake right opposite the site for a picturesque dip and lakeside walk. Little town short drive away for essential shopping/pubs. We stayed in the Dragon’s Den Lodge and would absolutely recommend it. 
It was clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The self check-in was very straight forward and all information and instructions were sent in advance of our stay. The staff we did come across were very friendly and helpful. 
We spoke to Claire, who gave us some great tips about the local area for walks and spots to visit. Would highly recommend. Thank you!",5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect little pods,"My friends and I stayed here to climb Snowdon. 
It was perfectly situated near the Watkins path and an amazing cafe.

 You must take midge repellant though!!! It is also within close distance to a picture postcard village. Great value.",5,,,,,,,OR
Pod camping,"
We are regular visitors to these pods and would just like to let everyone know just how excellent this site is. We went this time as a family of four the youngest 3 years he loved running around playing in the woods . It's location offers a great starting point to many fantastic walks without driving , especially the watkin path up Snowdon and if your not into walking all the way there are some stunning waterfalls a stone's throw from the road .The site offers a very warm welcome to everyone ,the pods are exceptionally clean and warm . There are restricted facilities on site at present due to covid rules but nothing that causes any issues as the owner has worked hard to make life as stress free as possible for you all. Nothing is too much trouble for the owner she will sort out any issues or give you advice on local attractions anything you need she is always on hand to help . We can't wait for our next visit which will probably be in the autumn due to work commitments. You will not be disappointed.",5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect location.,"Lovely little camp pod does everything you will need for a base, tea & coffee facilities, able to charge phone/tablet & WiFi if needed for £2.50 per day, nice & warm overnight, has picnic area & bbq area, shower facilities good, great position for walking the watkin path on Mt Snowdon literally 3mins up the road, would definitely stay again.",5,,,,,,,OR

It’s clean, comfortable and affordable. Will be going again soon",5,,,,,,,OR
Bryn Dina's Red Dragon,We as a family of 4 stayed in the Dragons Den lodge for 7 nights and really enjoyed. Ideal location for our walking plans and the lodge was clean and beds were very comfortable although 1 bedroom with 4 adults was a very manageable squeeze. All the kitchen items were provided and we were able to cooks full and proper meal. Toilet was a little on the small side but we knew about that in advance. Overall I would definitely stay there again. Very friendly staff.,5,,,,,,,OR
Great place to stay,"I stayed in one of the pods for 3 nights with my dog. The pod was comfortable and warm and the facilities very good. I do like the fact that each pod was allocated a shower room to use, I hope they continue to use this in the future. There was plenty of cleaner spray in the shower to wipe down after you have used it. I requested the pod away from the road, which I was given, thank you. It meant I had a lovely area to walk my dog off the lead for a quick widdle. I had a table and chairs outside so could sit and enjoy the bird song. The road is quite busy and fast during the day, but was not a problem at night time, this was one of my worries! Easy access to Snowdon and surrounding areas. Lovely walk around the lake nearby. A great place to stay. The communication before arriving was good, perhaps a few days earlier would have been better as I had already left home.",5,,,,,,,OR
May stay,"Brilliant stay! All facilities very clean, covid 19 safe place to stay. Great location surrounded with nature and close to all different hikes lakes etc great food in Beddgelert village. Highly recommended.",5,,,,,,,OR
"Camping Pod - Simple yet comfortable, exactly what we were after","This small site was exactly what we were after as a base for our travels around Eryri national park. The pods are simple yet comfortable, and were all we needed as most of our time was spent travelling around the national park.

The Pods

The pods are small but do the job just fine. The two singles push together easily to make a comfy bed. We expected a cold night in the pod so took extra blankets, but even with the radiator on low we had to open the window! The blinds let in just enough light to wake us up at a reasonable time and the lights and the lamp meant we could see just fine once the sun disappeard.

Bathroom

The bathrooms were in between all eight pods making them really easy to get to. With four bathrooms split between eight pods, we never had to wait around. The bathrooms were all done to a good standard and are kept very clean, with the availability of the cleaning supplies being a nice touch. Worth noting also that the shower was warm throughout, even with the other showers in use.
Kitchen
The pods have a kettle in the room, which were great for a coffee or a late night pot noodle, but no cooker. For us this wasn't an issue as we were out and about most of the time, but the microwave, sink and fridge available in the site's small kitchen room could definitely be useful if needed. Many of the other pods seemed quite happy with the outdoor BBQ area, with plenty of benches to eat and drink together.
The Area
On our drive in we made sure to stop at Llyn Gwynant, a beautiful lake right by the site. This was one of the many really pretty places nearby. The hills are incredible, especially in the sun, and there's plenty of stunning walks nearby. Around 200m away from the site is a great little Cafe, Caffi Gwynant, which offer both takeway and inside dining. We had breakfast there twice and left happy each time. Nearby is Beddgelert, a very pretty little town with a lot of great history and good pubs.
Essentially, If you're after something simple right at the foot of Snowdon, but are after something comfier than ordinary camping, then this place is perfect",5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect location for relaxation and hiking,"I've stayed with Red Dragon several times previously and was itching to get back after the long lockdown. The pods are in a fantastic location, with two large lakes within walking distance, stunning countryside all around and easy access to the Watkin Path, probably the most interesting route up Snowdon. With the charming village of Beddgelert just 2 miles away, there's a perfect balance between being able to relax and get away from it all without feeling like you're too far from civilisation (if, like me, you don't drive, the pods are also right on the Snowdon Sherpa bus route, which is a huge plus). There's also a cafe less than a 5 minute walk away, which I also highly recommend! The accommodation itself was, as always, spotlessly clean and comfortable, with everything I needed for my stay. Check in/out was simple and contactless, with plenty of hand sanitiser on site. I honestly didn't want to leave and am already planning my next stay!",5,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,OR
So good!,"Me and my partner stayed in Maple Log (wooden chalet). It was just perfect! Location- just next to the Watkins path, 10 min drive to Pen y Pass and so close to many other places around, there are two huge lakes and many walks around you. We also visited few towns and cities around us like Bangor and Portmerion which were only 30min drive away. Now cabin itself: very hot water, heathing inside, and the best part: the duvets and pillows are made with down and feathers so its so warm and cozy! In the evenings we were just sitting with our tea on the patio and look at the mountaims and birds. We will deffinetly go back there :) We had such an amazing holiday!",5,,,,,,,OR
Amazing - just like last year!,"Our second trip to the wonderful Red Dragon pods. My daughter and I had a fantastic time exploring the local area - we've been several times but are always amazed how much there is to do (even during a global pandemic!). The pods and bathrooms are beautifully clean and very well maintained and the surrounding areas are rustic and relaxing. I was very impressed as to how the company has dealt with the extra demands regarding Covid and I felt very safe. We had been assigned a bathroom and there were cleaning materials and instructions in there. There was also hand santiser on every gate, door and inside every pod. A wonderful stay all round - thank you again to Claire and her team!",5,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR

last Minute Booking,"Last Minute booking.
We got married on 29th February 2020 and decided to have a little break away as we can't honeymoon till next year.
We found Red Dragon Holidays online, booked on 2nd March and arrived on 3rd March.
We book Maple Lodge and I must say it is very spacious, clean and tidy. This is our first time staying in and we will certainly return for another visit.
The staff are very welcoming and chatty. Very helpful and happy to answer any questions.
Thank you for the little touches (The just married sign and lights)
Anyone wanting a little break away in a beautiful setting then Red Dragon is the place to come 😍.
We still have two days left but I thought I would write the review now as it is well worth a 5 Star Review
Thank you again

brilliant starting place for walks,"Stayed for 3 nights in one of the pods, very comfortable and everyone very friendly. Storm Brandon was on its way and the owners left us a torch and instructions on what to do in an emergency. we went for a walk and when we came back we had also been left a camping stove and tealights. Fortunately we didn't need them but really appreciated the thought. Will definitely stay there again. THANK YOU",5,,,,5.0,,5.0,OR
"Perfect, comfy and cosy","7 of us stayed in Snowdon Cottage for a long weekend as we were taking part in the Snowdonia Marathon.
The cottage was absolutely perfect, the location was beautiful with easy access to the Watkin path and close to Llyn Dinas lake.
It was lovely and warm when we arrived, scrupulously clean and had everything that we needed to make our stay a very comfortable one.
We couldn't recommend this enough and are planning to return next year.",5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect Snowdon base :),"We have visited these pods three times during 2019 with groups of up to 11 at a time and we have been impressed by the facilities, cleanliness, location and value for money on offer. Our group of work colleagues were walking Snowdon to raise funds for @GWAAC and used the pods as a base and they were absolutely perfect. They are compact but perfectly formed and have everything you need. They are cosy, spotlessly clean, the shower block is clean, warm and the showers are proper showers with great water pressure. The facilities continue outside the cabins with seating areas for everyone to use outside and bbq to cook on if you wish. The parking is directly outside, there are multiple places to eat close by and Snowdon (Pyg Track) is only a 15 minute drive. We would have no hesitation is visiting again and would recommend to anyone looking for value, convenience and cleanliness.",5,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,OR
Perfect base,"Found easily and upon arrival clear instructions via email and notice board by the entrance gate allowed us to find our pod.
Very clean, neat and tidy and perfect for our short stay in Wales.
Showers were again very clean although at certain times of the day you did have to wait for one to become free which was expected.
First night very comfortable we took sleeping bags rather than opting for the bed linen package.
Our second night was a little disturbed firstly by guests celebrating their holiday rather noisily until nearly 11pm. The community room which was right behind our pod, wasn't as advised in the welcome pack locked at 9pm to reduce this very thing happening... but at least they didn't go on all night so no real harm done.
Some late arrivals then turned up at nearly midnight and weren't quiet in announcing to their fellow travellers they had found where they were staying.
You do need to pay extra for Wifi at £2.50 per day which I was more than happy to pay but the group who were in the community room were freely sharing the password with everyone so maybe free wifi should be considered as I don't think this is the first time this has been done.
Check out was easy again clear instructions in the welcome pack and despite the minor issues with other guests it would certainly not stop us coming again and recommend others to stay.",5,,,,,,,OR
Outstanding,"Very clean and tidy, good service. Showers are spotless and fully accessible. Toilets and community room are all very close together so feels very homly. Fast check in. Parking could be better as you park on the road but no issue, 100% need car.",5,,,,,,,OR
Great place for a family gathering,"Thank you everyone from Red Dragon Holidays for a fantastic weekend break. Twenty members of our family hired two houses and two pods and had a brilliant time... laughing, feasting and a big group of us climbing snowdon in the sunshine. I recommend this site for anyone who loves the great outdoors and who wants to be in a perfect location for hill walking and relaxing. The accomodation is clean, well equiped and the service is efficient and friendly. This was out second visit and we will be back.",5,,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Great cottage,"We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2019. There were 9 of us that stayed which means we had to use the downstairs 2nd lounge as a bedroom. All of us were impressed by the quality and cleanliness of the cottage for such a great price. The kitchen is a bit of a squeeze with the large dining table, but we didn’t mind. Location wise it’s perfect for exploring the area and climbing Snowdon. It’s only 200m from start of Watkin path. Although this path is not for the feint hearted! The last couple hundred metres is a climb and not a walk!",5,,,,,,,OR
Philip,Well I stay here a few times a year and have to say you will not find a better place to stay and super value for money. The pods are clean well maintained comfortable and spacious . There are ample showers and toilets The site owner really goes above and beyond to help with your stay .she will advise on trips out but the information provided in your pods covers many attractions in the area .I cant wait to go back again .,5,,,,,,,OR
Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!!!!,"Me, my partner and our Springer spaniel stayed here for 3 nights and we could not be happier with our stay, it is an absolutely beautiful place, the pods are spacious and very clean, the shower facilities are the cleanest I've used while being away they are very private and I love the fact they are like a bathroom at home instead of using the shower and then having to go to another room to use the toilet! The fact that our 1 and a half year old dog could roam around exploring made me so happy no one complained about it and all fussed her instead she loved being free and not restricted. The views where stunning from every angle you stood at there was something even more mesmerising. The staff where so lovely very friendly and very helpful! We will definitely be coming back again soon and will be telling all our friends and families!",5,,,,,,,OR
THE BEST PLACE!!,"We have just returned from staying here and we cannot wait to go back! Me, my boyfriend and our husky stayed here Friday to Sunday and it didn't disappoint! the pods were so warm and cosy and had all tea making facilities, a heater and under bed storage. we paid for the luxury package, £10per night including all our bedding, towel and hand towel and wifi( no service at all). the shared bathrooms were so clean and there was never a problem waiting for a free shower or toilet. communal room, kitchen facilities and a washing machine on site too. the location of these pods are ideal too!!! We cannot wait to return!!",5,,,,,,,OR

Refreshing stay.,We are a middle aged couple who enjoy walking and relaxing .on this visit one of a few here the weather was favourable. Pods were dry warm and comfortable.

The owners are superb will help and advise on anything from where is best to eat to safety while walking . We stay here a few times and will be back many more such a wonderful place to stay for one night or a week .,5,,,,,,,OR
Maple lodge,"Cosy little log cabin located on a country road! Well equipped with all essentials and even a welcome pack which was an unexpected pleasant surprise!
Parking is limited and on a country road. Little village is a short drive away. Fab location for climbing snowdon via Watkin path",5,,,,,,,OR
Tryfan tryffic,"This time we stayed in one of the cottages for a week. Tryfan, the smallest of the cottages but still spacious enough for us two and two greyhounds. It was cool as well in exceptionally hot weather.
Wifi can be intermittent but given the location this is hardly surprising. It was good enough for me to do the little bit of work that I needed to do.
Very clean and well kept cottage. Plenty of room. Shower was good and the bed VERY comfortable!
We were somewhat restricted in what we could do on our stay this time as we had a dog with a broken leg. Had a lovely garden area to chill in so not a problem-we still enjoyed our stay and will return once dog is mended to do more next time.",5,,,,,,,OR

Fabulous hide away,"Stayed for 3 nights in the pods, perfect location for walking and exploring the beautiful area and close to some of the walking routes up Snowdon. Very clean and spacious and had comfortable beds. Always had hot water and the bathroom cabin was always warm.

Very good cafe 5 mins walk away which is open 9am - 5pm very good breakfasts and afternoon tea.
Definitely planning to go back at the end of summer.",5,,,,,,,OR
Would go back,I booked all four cottages as well as Maple Log Cabin for friends and family (3nights) as we were attending a wedding at Llyn Gwynant Barns nearby.

One always feels a sense of responsibility when booking for over 20 different personalities. Happy guests here!,5,,,,,,,OR
Snowdonia walking holiday,"This is third time at Red Dragon Holidays, as good as ever. Fantastic base for walking, plenty of walks from the cottage. Cottage well presented, and has all the basics.

A wonderfully exhausting weekend in North Wales,"My main purpose for the trip was a gift voucher for Zip World Bounce Below, which I then added Zip World Caverns onto for day 1 and then planned to climb Snowdon on day 2 so basically needed somewhere to lay out heads at night in prep for our jam-packed weekend! What we got was SO much more; the pods were cosy and comfortable for 2 with all facilities including tea & coffee in the room, bathroom cubicles including shower, toilet and sink rather than shower blocks and toilet blocks which we thought was amazing AND communal area, kitchenette and washing/drying block. It was located around 20 minutes from our ZipWorld location and Porthmadog where we got a takeaway dinner, and a short walk from the Watkin path where we started and ended our amazing 8 hour hike! I absolutely adored this campsite and will try my very hardest to make a return visit - even willing to make the 4 hour car drive again!!",5,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,OR
My little haven for the night,"I stayed in a Red Dragon camping pod during a long expedition-type run. I was carrying minimal kit and arrived late at night after rather more 'excitement' in the dark and fog up on Cnicht than I had bargained for. Not having a car and being on foot, it was so great to be able to stay somewhere fairly remote, with a hot shower, warm pod, duvet, towel etc. I fell inside, sent 'I'm safe' message using pre-booked wifi (no mobile reception in the area and for some time before I arrived), got cleaned up, boiled the kettle to make and eat my freeze dried meal and fell fast asleep. In the morning - my stomach woke me up and led me directly to Caffi Gywnant, where I got an amazing breakfast before heading back to Llanberis. Thanks!",5,4.0,5.0,,,,4.0,OR

Fantastic 3 night stay for family of 4,"We stayed in the Dragon's Lair, which was really warm and cosy and ample room for 2 adults and kids for a few nights, especially as it was so easy to access the community room for meals/ a cup of tea and sit down etc. Lovely views and cute bbq area, clean and tidy bathroom block. Good exploring for kids out the back. Also wanted to say how kind and helpful staff were, especially Alwyn who was very understanding and lovely about a small incident we had while we were staying.

Lovely pods,"We stayed for Saturday night after our walk up Snowden. The key was waiting when we arrived. Walked in to a warm snug pod. Nice and clean. It was perfect for what we needed. We drove into Beddgelert for tea ( 5 mins) which was lovely then drove back. The toilets and showers were clean, well kept and always smelt nice. Reception staff were friendly and a great cafe 5 minutes walk from the pods. All together a great little place and we hope to come back in the summer.",5,,,,,,,OR
Birthday treat,The pod was excellent.Very clean and we'll equipt. Even had corkscrew ( very handy as had forgotten to bring ) and hot water bottles !! The amenities were excellent with everything needed provided and the bathrooms were awesome. The location was stunning and the stay was the icing on my friends birthday treat. The staff we saw were very helpful and friendly. Thank you for a memorable break.,5,,,,,,,OR
"Great location, hospitality and comforr","We stayed in a pod in March for 2 nights, it was excellent value for money and the facilities were excellent! The pod was cosy with heating and electricity and very clean and the bathrooms had everything you needed set up really well, almost like bathroom at home, the only thing we thought was that in busier times of year, the communal areas including the bathrooms might get very busy.
We arrived when the staff had left and they made it very easy for us to sort everything out and gave excellent advice about hikes in the area and were extremely friendly.
There are 2 sets of kitchen facilities one in a hut nearer the pods-so useful for BBQs etc with running water, microwave and fridge and one in the communal area with fridge/freezer, toaster and microwave-but with no running water.
The communal area has OS maps but you have to be lucky if you want one of the direct area (we were unlucky and hiked without one)
Overall great experience and would definitely visit again!",5,,5.0,,4.0,,4.0,OR
A cosy little place!!!,"My mum, myself and my little dog stayed one night in a camping pod at Bryn Dinas. The camping pods are lovely, cosy and well equipped with everything you need.

There is 2 single divan beds (with plenty of storage space), tea and coffee making facilities, a heater, hot water bottles, large umbrella, an information booklet and cutlery. There is a shower, toilet and dry room cabin, a little kitchenette, a laundry cabin (£1.00 for an hour washing or drying) and a community cabin, which has plenty of benches and tables, a kettle and toaster, a microwave, a payphone and a pc with internet all situated a few yards away from the pods. There are plenty of walks to explore nearby and around beddgelert. There is a cafe and Wakin path (a start of a walking route to snowdon) can be found 300 yards down the road. Beddgelert is 2 miles away and is a very dog friendly place in the pubs, shops and around the village. We had a brilliant stay I just wished we stayed for longer it was lovely and peaceful. We will definitely be stay here again in the near future.",5,,,,,,,OR
Excellent little find,Took my son for his 16th. An excellent base for the walks and Zip World where we also visited. Will definitely be returning. We’re not hardened campers by any means but the facilities that were on offer here really took me by surprise. I’d brought all sorts I didn’t need! Teenager didn’t even mind lack of 4G and the puns in the nearby village were lovely.,5,,,,,,,OR

Really suggested to those who love camping and willing to experience in the nature.",5,,,,,,,OR
Magical holiday destination,"Set alongside ancient woodland this is a magical place for people who love the natural world.

Perfect for an overnight stopover,"I really wanted to try Glamping, I have been camping lots of times but wanted something with a little more comfort and less equipment. We were heading to Wales to do the fastest Zip line in Europe at Zip World and needed somewhere to stay that wasnt too far a drive.
This place was perfect, beautiful surroundings and close to a little village with a shop, pub and a couple of places to eat.
We paid an extra couple of £s to have duvets so we didnt have to pack sleeping bags. There were tea and coffee facilities in the pod and power and a heater.",5,,,,,,,OR
Great little pod.,I went for 2 nights with my dog for a bit of a get away. Nice and tidy place and the staff were great too. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting a nice place in a lovely setting near Beddgelert,5,,,,,,,OR
"Relaxing, Friendly and very Clean","We stayed at these pods in August this year. My husband and I stayed in the pods and a family of 4 stayed in the main room, next to the communal area. 
The people were very friendly and helpful.
The pods themselves were clean and had tea/coffee making facilities available.
The communal approach was very relaxing and full of like minded walkers. The whole experience was just so relaxing and very friendly.
The pods were warm and the showering facilities was more than adequate",5,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,OR
One night stop after reaching the top.,"As part of a team building excise we booked all of the pods for a group of 10 of us. The place really was great, the pods were very warm, with cosy bedding and only a few steps away from the shower/toilet block. The little area out front had some tables and benches and so we could all sit together and have a well earned BBQ after the 6 or so hours of walking. We all thoroughly enjoyed the experience and everyone thought the pods were great.
We would definitely recommend this as a fantastic little spot!",5,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR
Red Dragon,"We enjoyed our stay in the camping pods. The beds were comfortable, the wifi good and the pods very warm with the heating. Although the showers and toilet were situated in a separate house the facilities were very good and the showers very warm. It was well situated for what we wanted to do and is only a small drive to Snowdon for those wanting to climb it. Would happily stay again as it was well priced.",5,,,,,,,OR
Amazing place,"Visited with friends for the weekend and can't begin to say what a fantastic experience it was . Stayed in the pods the first night and had the best night in the communal area then second night in the cottage . Truly wonderful setting - stopped at the cafe for a full Welsh breakfast before a day of visiting the skate mine , miners hospital and a train ride up Snowdon and a bracing walk down. Many thanks to Clare and Neil for a wonderful stay .",5,,,,,,,OR
"A perfect, inexpensive alternative to camping","This is a great alternative to camping if its too cold or your group won't fully embrace the great outdoors. The pods are cosy, there are two single beds separated by about 3ft of space. There is just enough room at the end of each bed to stash a rucksack. There is a table, lights, heating and bedding available on request. The wifi is good enough to read an email and the communal areas including bathrooms are clean and well maintained.
The pods are right on the roadside (approx 10m) behind a small gate and a wall so if you have young children you may need to be aware. However the road is very quiet at night and its about 2 miles to Bedgellert where you will find pubs and restaurants.
Overall an inexpensive place to stay and better than camping, for some!",5,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,OR
Great Customer Service,We stayed at the pod for just one night whilst visiting friends in the area. Lovely quirky little pods. We had 2 single beds and it was just the right size for myself and my 2 little boys. Even our dog squeezed in! Bedding pack was well worth it - good quality and what surprised me most was how comfy the mattresses were - I hadn't expected much but these were as comfy as many hotels Ive stayed at! I left my pillow (comes with me everywhere as I normally have now expectations) and Clare called to let me know. I then realised on arriving home I had left a necklace and Clare kindly sent this on to my friend for me. Great customer service & good communication throughout!,5,,5.0,,,5.0,4.0,OR
Superb weekend away in a pod,"Just returned from a fantastic weekend away with my wife. We stayed in a pod, this was a really great experience, something that I will do again and definitely here in Wales with Red Dragon.
The pod was small and cosy but perfect in every way. I expected to get cold but absolutely not the temperature inside was great. The beds are two single fairly comfy beds at either side of the pod with storage underneath. There is also tea and coffee making facilities inside the pod. It's worth paying extra for the luxury pack so you get towels and bedding provided. In terms on entertainment you have yourself, you could take a tablet and stream through wifi if you wanted some evening activities.
The shower block is clean and well maintained, I hate camping due to the thought of the showers and toilets but this place was perfectly clean and the water was hot!! You also have a nice community area and kitchen area. There is a lovely cafe that serves breakfast a short walk away or a village with shops and pubs not far either.
I can't wait to go back",5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect for our needs - excellent location,"We wanted somewhere to stay that was not too expensive, good for walking, dog friendly and dry if the weather was too wet for camping . The pods fitted the bill; we could dine inside or outside, dry our wet clothing; have comfortable beds and enjoy hot showers in clean well maintained bathrooms. And all cutlery, crockery, kettle etc were provided. It was an easy walk into Beddgelert on a lovely path round the lake and only 100 meters from the start of the Watkin path up Snowdon",5,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,OR
amazing location. lovely place!,Pod was lovely. second time we've stayed here before climbing Snowdon the following day. Pod surprisingly spacious and the area outside so you can cook food or chill is amazing on the road side. Shower rooms etc all clean and tidy. No complaints and for the money you can't go wrong!,5,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,OR
Perfect for a short stay in Snowdonia,"The camping pods were full but we were lucky enough to get the Maple Lodge Log Cabin, which sleeps four and has its own bathroom and kitchen. It was very snug and toasty warm. There's not a ton of space if there's four of you, but for a short stay it was perfect. It's in a beautiful spot and you can just head straight out the door to a fantastic cafe in an old converted chapel less than five minutes walk away, and then on to the Watkin Path up Snowdon, or drive round the corner if you want the Pyg or Miner's tracks. Would love to come back next year.",5,,4.0,,4.0,5.0,,OR
Ideal for those who love camping but want the home comforts,"Pods lovely, cozy and warm with lots of room for two people. I had the best nights sleep for ages!

Brilliant Camping pods for a short week away,"The pod was perfect for what we needed.

The pod and washing facilities are also immaculately clean with no shortage of hot water . Plenty of walks for everyone.

Group Stay with friends,"Great accommodation, great location, good for groups/friends/family.
Easy to book, great communication with the owner.
Only 30 mins to Snowdon Mountain Railway and Zip World.
4 good size bedrooms and very large bathroom.",5,,,,,,,OR
Top notch,"My sister and I stayed in Snowdon Cottage, which is decorated and fitted to a high standard. We loved it. I had my dog with me and he enjoyed it too. Lots of room and even had a dishwasher and very handy washing machine. When it's been raining, you have a waterfall just outside the back door: beautiful and peaceful! Lots of lovely birds and wildlife to watch outside too.
There is *no* phone signal here so ensure you print off your arrival instructions before you leave home so you know what to do when you arrive. The wifi provided is really good and worth the extra tenner for the week.
The places are dog friendly but I would have been happier if the area round the back was enclosed. I'm used to letting my dog out the back door to do his business and had to go out with him on a lead here. He'd have run off to another cottage or worse, out in the road. You also have to be prepared to share the back garden space and parking is first come, first served.
Drying space is minimal: no idea how large families staying would cope. Temperature was ideal on June but I'm not sure how you'd fare in cooler months as you can't adjust the thermostats.",5,,,,,,,OR
Great little place to stay!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights whilst we was seeing different destinations around North Wales. There is 5 cabins named after castles in North Wales which has two single beds inside, there is a communal bathroom, laundry room and washing up area. Wifi you have to pay an extra £2.50 a day which is needed as there is no signal for quite a few miles around there. There is a lovely place for breakfast a mile down the road to the left and the next village down en route to Porthmadog that has nice restaurants for lunch and dinner.",5,,,,,,,OR
Daughters Wedding Rentals,"There are 4 cottages - one sleeping 10, one sleeping 7, and 2 able to sleep 4 people. The cottages comprise of two buildings - 1 being the 7 sleeper cottage (Snowdon) and the other being divided into the 10 (Aran) and 2 x 4 sleeper cottages (Syngun & Tryfan)
We hired all 4 cottages as family accommodation for my daughters wedding a couple of weekends ago. She was getting married at LLyn Gwynant Barns a short drive away. The 2 larger cottages (Snowdon & Aran) are both modern and tastefully decorated, clean and comfortable. Syngun and Trefyn are much smaller but perfectly comfortable with pretty much everything you would need for a stay in Wales. I stayed in Tryfan cottage - this is the smallest cottage and as it is situated at the back of the house there is limited light access, making it feel smaller that it is. But as we were not spending a great deal of time in the cottage this was no real issue for us. Onsite were also sleeping pods and communal showers and washing facilities. Some guests had a pod and these also looked clean, dry and comfortable.
If you would like a holiday in a beautiful part of Wales with some good solid accommodation then I can't recommend anywhere better. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The only problem here is the lack of mobile phone signal. We could have done with it for the weekend as so many people were coming into the area for the wedding and needed to keep in contact....but we managed. I would say however if you are here for a holiday and need to get away from it all then I would see this a bonus and it's also not the fault of the owners - just a geographical thing.....a small price to pay for such a beautiful place. We did however have excellent wifi in the cottages. We are hoping to return in the future to explore the area further and will definitely book this accommodation again if available.",5,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,OR
Work trip up a mountain or 2!!,"8 of us from work stayed in the pods for a weekend walking. They were clean, different, comfortable and just perfect.

Perfect.",5,5.0,,,5.0,,,OR

"Brilliant location, with everything you need!","Stayed in for two night early June 2017. Initially meant to be with three other friends, so had the Dragons Lair. However two couldn't join us, so we had plenty of space. May be a bit tight with four adults and all there walking gear. Kettle, tea and fridge which was amazing. We brought our own sleeping bags but bed were comfy. Paid for wifi too, which was great as no phone signal. Only a few mins to Penn Y Pass and after a long hike in the rain, the showers were fantastic. Also a laundry room to help with our wet clothes. Didn't meet the owners (we arrived late fridaynight and instructions left) until 10mins before we checked out. Would definitely recommend this place to stay!!",5,,3.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR
"Clean, comfortable, well-equipped","We paid a little extra for bedding and wifi so everything was provided for our stay - the cabins were clean, beds comfy and bedding warm.
There is a shared block with bathrooms which were clean, warm and spacious with amazing showers! Just what we needed after a long day in the mountains.
There was also a kettle and plenty of sockets in the room, along with crockery and cutlery (useful!) as well as a microwave, fridge and kettle in the shared kitchen area. Super-easy access from the road and just a couple of minutes' walk from the Watkin path if you want to head up Snowdon.
Great value, would 100% stay again.",5,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,OR

Snowden Cottage - great hideaway,"I went for a long weekend with my partner and our 8 year old dog. We had a fantastic time. Snowden cottage had everything you needed. It was clean, tidy and spacious. Whilst your there you must try the cafe down the road and if you have dogs the beach at black sands is amazing. We will be going back as it offered everything we needed at a great price.",5,,,,,,,OR
Glamping!,"Very friendly, great area although not near anything imparticular- we did have to drive for food & the pubs. The beds weren't very comfy but fine for a couple of nights :) The pod was brilliant with a heater and kettle inside. Lots of plug sockets to use and very glad we booked for the wifi password. More spacious than we thought :)",5,,,,,,,OR
Quite retreat,This is an amazing place. You are right on the door step of some amazing countryside. You are close enough if need be to local amenities. Black rock beach is not far away.

Look no further,"We booked all 5 pods for our Snowdon tip. Communications was great. The pods are clean, warm and comfortable. Every amenity you will need are there and all set in a great location. Although next to the road, it's very, very quiet during the night and sleep is not disturbed by it.
We will return as it's such great value. Thank you.",5,1.0,,1.0,,,,OR
Comfort and adventure in the Dragon's Lair,"Myself and 5 friends stayed at the Red Dragon pods for 2 nights.
Located in the beautiful landscapes of Snowdonia, which if you're lucky enough to catch on sunny day is truly amazing. The views really speak for themselves.
The pods themselves are great - a step above 'glamping' ! - We were fortunate enough to have the Dragon's Lair pod to accommodate 4 and consequently we were able to enjoy the extra space (though a communal area by day). Beds were comfy, giant fridge, heater and tea facilities!
The wash room facilities were excellent, better than most campsites I've experienced in the past . The shower pressure is actually better than my own at home; much appreciated after climbing Snowden.
The only negative we found would be the distance to the local village of Beddgelert. Fine for a short drive, but if you all fancy a bit of of a celebration, it's about a 40minute walk. We booked a taxi one evening, however the taxi has to come from the next town along so costs around £40 - (we walked most times).
But otherwise, can't recommend this accommodation enough!",5,5.0,4.0,,,,5.0,OR
Pleasant Stay,"This place is a steal ... the pod are amidst woodlands which make you feel closer and connected to nature..
just a few mins walk from the Watkins path.. hence best if this is ur base to climb the summit.
Although we were a bit worried how the shared bathroom and toilets would be .. I would say they have been maintained at with highest standards of cleanliness..
The pods are very cosy and tidy and you would feel very comfortable in the tiny space..a nice place to rest after a tired day..
I would love to go back here ..and spend some time in the lap of mother Earths nature far away from the bustle.:",5,,,,,,,OR
Super cosy,"Pods are cosy, warm, tidy and reasonably priced. Showers had good pressure and were hot. Staff were friendly and informative.
Beddgelet itself is a decent walk away, far easier to drive in but the walk around the lake was spectacular on a sunny day.
We used this as a base for climbing snowdon and it was perfect. We woke up to the sound of nothing but nature. Would go back 100%",5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect,"What can i say stayed here bank holiday with my 6 year old daughter. She'd absolutely loved it as so did i. Staff were very friendly, pod was warm and very comfy. Very peaceful , great surroundings. Will defo be returning in the summer.",5,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,OR
A hidden gem in the treasure of snowdonia,"We booked these via Trivago rather than go for the usual camp sites we tend to end up at. Fancied a little luxury - and these really delivered. Beautifully kept, clean and merging into the natural beauty that surrounds, these pods were a god send. Comfortable beds, electric (charging is a new importance nowadays!) and wifi - I felt like a child in a fantastic tree house. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
And let's be honest, the whole area is Britains garden of Eden.
If you're going to explore snowdonia/snowdon then I would urge you to check Red Dragon out before everywhere else.
We WILL be coming back.",5,,,,,,,OR
Cute and cosy!,"Awesome pod, very cute and cosy. Warm with the heater and rented blankets. Love the atmosphere. There was a small hiccup when we arriving, the blankets and wifi code having been left in another pod by accident, but it was hastily fixed and we were all set for an awesome journey! The only thing is the proximity of other pods that make it a little noisy when people talk loud outside, but the scenery is amazing, the little town charming and the noise of baby sheep in the distance is the best way to fall asleep :)",5,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,OR
Just perfect. Review of Bryn Dinas Camping pods,"Lovely camping pods, really just like being in tents but much more comfy. Everything you need and more. Power supply in the pods. Not much space so need to be organised if more than one in a pod, perfectly adequate and bigger than a two person tent. Automatic lighting on sensors, very safe, right on the road but very quiet. There is grassy field opposite to take the dogs on. Black out blinds and curtains for those that find it tricky to close their eyes. Right next door to the start of the best way up Snowdon, Watkin Path.",5,,,,,,,OR
Best way to explore the beautiful surrounding area!,"After my sister winning a stay here a couple of years ago, we were quick to book when we saw Sygun Cottage was available for a couple of nights! Yet again, we were not disappointed. We've really found our spot of pure relaxation as a family, in the comfy and homely cottage. Determined to return again multiple times in the future, with family and friends! Couldn't think of a better way to spend a couple of nights exploring the beauty of Snowdonia and surrounding areas.",5,,,,,,,OR

"Cozy pods, great location!","We stayed here at the end of March for 2 nights, what a great set up they have got there! The pods are smaller than ones we've stayed in before but still plenty big enough for a few nights and even with our 2 dogs with us. The site is really well equipped with plenty of seating, washing up and laundry areas, the indoor communal area is really good too, plenty of room for larger groups to get together somewhere warm if its a bit chilly or raining. The location is ideally situated for walking Snowdon via the Watkin Path - the start of it is literally 2 mins walk up the road. The pods are right next to the road but the traffic didn't bother us as the road was most busy during the day when I'd imagine you'd be getting ready to go out anyway, the views are still lovely. Would definitely stay here again, fab place!!",5,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,OR
Second visit - great place!,Just back from our second stay here in Sygun cottage. Lovely place in beautiful surroundings. The cottage has everything you need and booking is easy. When I telephoned to book we were remembered from our last visit. A great comfortable base to explore this stunning area.,5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect for price and stay over,"me and 4 other friends stayed overnight here before walking Snowdon. we advised the owner we'd be arriving quite late, although we didn't actually meet them as we arrived, we were told it was no problem and was given a code to access our key.
Me and 2 others stayed in the dragons lair (bunk bed) which was attached to the community room. the room was clean and looked very cosy. The room heats up ALOT, we arrived feeling like we entered a
We arrived late Friday night march 31st. Stayed in the dragons lair.
The room was like a sauna (i loved it, my two friends thought it was too much) but there was no problem at all, we turned off the heather and still had enough warmth in the room for the night. we had a full sized fridge and freezer to store our food overnight and thank god for the wifi (we had no signal at all) to let our loved ones know we arrived safe and sound.
I loved the fact dogs were allowed to stay in the pods, although I did feel bad for walking past the smaller cabins to head to the loos and hearing the dogs bark, probably waking whoever was sleeping up. But I suppose that's what you'd expect as owners taking your dog to hear them bark in unfamiliar places hearing noises.
I read reviews here to say the toilets and showers were horrific and was half expecting to not use the facilities, but I was surprised and happy to see (and quite annoyed at those who put bad reviews up misleading others) because the toilets and showers were clean as ever and better than what I expected.
I would highly recommend staying here for a overnight stay. I'm not 100% sure if I'd recommend for anyone staying more only because it's in the middle of no where and 20 mins drive to Llanberis but I suppose if you are that outdoorsy type who is content staying in your pod or a BBQ in the courtyard then fire away. But if you're not then be prepared to drive elsewhere for the day to explore or kill time.
I found the Snowdon trek amazing and I'd love to do it again so I'd be more than happy to stay here again, and maybe even try the two man pods as my other two friends stayed in these and they looked super cosy and cute.
There's nothing better than hearing rain as you try to sleep.
The only other thing I'd say for improvement is the bunk beds have safety railings at the top. I volunteered to take top bunk as I knew my friends wouldn't and I can't say I had the best nights sleep but that was only because of my fear of falling off, I put a pillow behind my back and that helped but I think it's because I'm quite a fidgety in my sleep that I couldn't relax in fear of rolling off.
Other than that it was perfect!!",5,,,,,,,OR
Brilliant Short Stay,"We were absolutely delighted!
Due to only staying the one night, we didn't use the communal area, but the cabin and surroundings were lovely.
We were very lucky with the weather which was ideal to relax by the picnic benches with a beer 😊
Although we didn't stay long, I was greeted with a Birthday Banner in the cabin, which I thought was a lovely touch & Thank you Red Dragon 🎉
We had a big dog staying with us, and there was enough room for her on the floor, but i wouldn't recommend taking more than a bag each as the rooms are small and cosy.
Suited us & will definitely be coming back!!",5,,,,,,,OR
Brilliant experience,"My partner and I decided to stay in one of these pods, due to how cheap they were and we still wanted a sort of camping experience, I wasn't expecting much but when we arrived we were so surprised how nice they were, so cosy with heating already on for our arrival, the communal shower and toilets were spotless and pretty modern. Will diffinitley be coming back!",5,,,,,,,OR
Weekend stay in Conwy Castle Pod,"Both myself and my boyfriend stayed here for one night, currently on the way home from our stay. Even though we wasn't at the pod for a huge amount of time (only 1 night stay), we were delighted.
The pod was very clean, and just what we needed. Two single beds, little bedside table with a kettle on top, a mini radiator and a lamp. The only downside was that the beds were extremely creaky, so if you are a light sleeper be warned you may be woken up by the person in the other single bed.
The showers and toilets were also just what we needed. Otherwise, we did not venture into the communal or storage areas.
Benches just outside the pods which were great for relaxing with a beer in the evening, and for a cuppa in the morning. Little BBQ area which we wish we had prepared for, but for only one night we had a treat out.
The location of the pods were spot on for us, especially as this was our first trip to Snowdonia. A walking route up snowdon just up the road, and in the opposite direction a lovely public walk around the lake. The pods are then all within good driving distances to lovely villages and beautiful scenery.
Overall, very very happy with our stay. We will 100% be returning",5,,,,,,,OR
Lovely visit,"My wife and I planned on visiting Snowdonia and decided on staying at this great site. We stayed for 2 nights 6-8 March. The pods are excellent, great value, very warm and cosy, the shower rooms are fantastic and if you are staying longer than we did there's the added bonus of a laundry room. All in all a great site and we'll definitely visit again",5,,,,,,,OR
Fabulous trip,"I booked this very special trip for a surprise engagement; the owner, Claire, was amazing at helping me plan the where's and when's and kindly purchased a couple of bottles of champagne for me and placed them outside the cabin on ice for our arrival back.
The cabin was amazing, kitted out with all that u need, it's warm and cozy with a romantic feel, a great feel to it from to moment u see it. We took our 2 springer spaniels and they were nice and relaxed, enough room for them to 'spring' about. The double bed was very comfortable. We didn't use the mezzanine level but I looked great and would be an exciting get place to sleep now matter what age u are.
In the evenings we enjoyed stepping out onto the decking and relaxing under the stars, not a sound other that nature.
We have stayed in one of the pods on site previously and that was also amazing!

Great little stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights in February - had everything you could need (charging sockets, tea making facilities, comfy beds). Very short walk from Watkin path (another nice walk 200m away on the left). Close to Beddgelert and Porthmadog (cosy pubs in both). Friendly guests. Very clean/ warm shower/ and shower rooms, with a place to hang wet clothes. Ample parking out front. Great value for money too. I'm almost reluctant to spread the word of this treasure!

Snowdens in Snowdonia,We visited in Autumn last year with our Labrador dog.

Brilliant!,"We stayed here for a February half term break and it was absolutely brilliant. The camping pods are spotless, warm and cosy. We stayed in cosy Caernarfon castle which was wonderful. The location is really convenient for a lot of lovely walks in the Welsh countryside and a short drive to local villages.
The bathroom facilities are also really clean and the showers are brilliant! We paid for wifi and linen and this was definitely money well spent.
The staff were really helpful and the whole place was just so easy and comfortable to stay at. One of the best ""glamping"" We've ever stayed at globally! Bring a few drinks and snacks and box sets and you'll have a lovely cosy time! Thank you!",5,,,,,,,OR
fantastic,"this place is just lovely.
fantastic little Pods and everything you need they had literally everything crockery, cutlery, microwave,kettle, hairdryer etc. they even had two hot water bottles inside the pods.. the location is just breathtaking and to be fair the owners we so helpfull. we stayed for valentine's night and had a little barbecue outside and just relaxed on site.. if I had one thing to say the place would benefit from it would be a little fire pit to sit around in the night.. but other than that u couldn't ask for more. I will be returning here in the summer.",5,,,,,,,OR
Pods,"My boyfriend and I have never visited this area before and were sceptical as to whether it was for us, but I'm so glad we did! We stayed in the beautiful pod 'Conwy castle.' It was absolutely spotless and lovely and warm! The facilities were lovely and clean and the outside area was well kept. The owners were extremely friendly too and any information needed about anything was answered. We were pleasantly surprised that pets were allowed to stay too! Unfortunately our puppy did not join us this time but will definitely come with us next time! We adored the family of goats that are on the premises too- it was a lovely surprise to see! The surrounding area is breathtaking too!
We will be visiting again in the near future and recommend everyone to stay here!",5,,,,,,,OR
Annual friends holiday,"Stayed in aran cottage for a 4 night short break. We go away as 2 families end of January every year and this was our first visit to this area as a group. The cottage was large enough to accommodate all of us with no problem. Love the sitting room and kitchen are one large room as it meant we could all be together. Would have been good to have had a TV in the other lounge as well as this had the really comfy sofas. Although there is a bath and a shower they are both in the same room so not ideal when it is a group sharing. Also if you are wanting a bath it will take ages to run due to low water pressure. However other than these minor points could not fault it and would recommend to other and certainly return in the future. If you want some excitement and have a head for heights go and try zip world caverns well worth the money. 3 hours of climbing, zip wires and excitement loved every minute. Four of us did it aged 25 to 55 go and give it a go.",5,,,,,,,OR
Fabulous. As always,"Recently back from our 4th visit to Red Dragon, 2nd time in Snowdon cottage. Yet again, we weren't let down. From the gorgeous welcome pack (bread, milk, mince pies, wine, sweets - all the essentials!) to the lovely clean cottage with fabulous views, you simply cannot go wrong with this accommodation. There were 6 of us in Snowdon, my brother and his family had Sygun and our friends had Tryfan. Snowdon kitchen was the focal point for all our socialising - 11 people, 6 dogs, it was just amazing. It's only a couple of miles away from Bedgellert, only metres from the Watkin path up Snowdon, with loads of beautiful walks in the vicinity. Claire and her staff can't do enough for you, even though our dogs kept barking at them for having the gall to clean the cottages!!! It's so good that we've already booked for New Year 2017/18. I simply can't recommend this complex enough. I've stayed in Sygun, Maple Lodge and Snowdon and never been disappointed. Miss this at your peril!!!",5,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,OR
"Cosy, comfortable and great value","Warm, cosy and well-equipped little eco-friendly camping pods in a great location for hiking and exploring. 15-20 mins drive from the start of the popular Pyg Track up Snowdon, and many other great hiking spots.
The pods have comfortable beds, heating, nice bedding if you request it, and a kettle with brew kit. There are BBQ facilities, microwave and books in the communal areas, and a very picturesque village with several pubs just 5 mins drive away.
Highly recommended.",5,,,,,,,OR
We want to come back asap!,"We absolutely loved this place. Small and compact pods but still comfortable enough to enjoy. Tea/coffee facility, clean shared bathrooms, good area to eat breakfast outside. The surroundings are perfect and so close to the path to climb Snowdon (which we enjoyed so much). The price was very good too.
We only stayed one night but I would love to come back and stay a bit longer.
The only disadvantage was no double bed (2 singles instead).
Claire was very responsive to emails and seemed to be very lovely. We arrived late at night (around midnight) and she didn't have issues with that at all, she left the keys for us and explained everything in an email.
We will be in touch with Claire for sure next time we want to visit. Lovely place with affordable accommodation.",5,,,,,,,OR
Fab weekend in Snowdon Cottage,"My wife and I were here for 3 days and had a fabulous time.
We were in Snowdon Cottage - very roomy and all of the facilities within the cottage that you are ever likely to need. And the double bed within the main bedroom was very comfortable!
Location wise it is brilliant - only 400 yards or so to the start of the Watkin Trail up Snowdonia, about 2 miles from Beddgelert Town and a short drive to Porthmadog.
This place is well worth a try if you are looking for a Snowdonia base - we will be back!",5,,,,,,,OR

"First ""Pod"" Experience - Excellent!","This was our first ""Podding"" experience and we couldn't have chosen better! Beautiful location (with an awesome cafe just down the road where we had Belgian Waffles, Bacon and Maple Syrup for breakfast!!), the pods were spotlessly clean, well presented and (very) warm! We even opened the window during the night it was so warm.....and this in October!

Bathrooms were spacious and the showers had good water pressure and went very hot if you want it. Little kitchenette and washing up stand and laundry room very helpful touch.

We paid the extra for wifi in the pod (we can't live without it) and while you won't be watching the latest episode of WestWorld on your SkyNOW app it is enough to check emails and Facebook. Sadly the wifi wasn't working on the second night (and we didn't die) but the helpful lady had it working again in the morning after a router reboot.

We took our greyhound and all three of us fit fine in our little pod for 2 nights.

Would totally go back again. Probably will....would be lovely in the winter I think.",5,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,OR
"Wonderful, better than expected.","Stayed 3 nights. Had Dragons Lair and a Pod. Very impressed. Pod compact but very cleverly thought out. Everything you could need, although my friend would have liked a mirror for her lippy lol. Bathroom block very clean, towels changed daily. Warm. Always hot water. Community Room excellent , very warm and everything you would need. Definitely visit again. Very central. Enjoyed little village of Beddgelert. Walked Snowdon and did Zip Wire. You won't be disappointed. Claire the owner, very accessible and approachable. Enjoy . Further down asking about Hotel Style and amenities. Mostly not relevant. Not easy to answer.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hopefully we will be back . Kate and Ken.",5,,,,,,,OR
Amazing stay!!,"Stayed for two night as a base to climb Snowden, stayed with two friends in the dragons Lair attached to the common room. Really clean and comfortable beds. The common room had great WIFI and plenty of space to eat and drink. The shared bathroom were really clean and you really get a feeling for the camping experience whilst staying in the pods. Met staff the last morning and were really friendly. Great location close to all Snowden trail starting points, and 20 minutes to a beautiful beach you drive on to, defiantly stay again",5,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,OR

Simply stunning,"Red Dragon Holidays really do have something very special indeed. Me and my girlfriend stayed for just one night and after a long drive from the Midlands, we were met by Claire in the communal area of the site. Like us she's from Midlands but from the moment we'd arrived in Nant Gwynant, we could see the reasons why she'd moved to this beautiful part of the country.

We stayed in the pod named Criccieth Castle and as we approached the pod, our key was on a hook along with a post-it note with my girlfriends name on (She booked it!)

We paid extra for towels and bed sheets and both were clean and fresh for us to use. The pod was simple but as you'd expect. It was warm, dry and considering you're in the woods, it was impecably clean! There was a hospitality tray in the room along with cutlery & crockery but that really is all you need.. Simple!

They have 2 bathrooms on site as well as a single toilet. They also have a laundry room, 2 x kitchen areas with fridge, toaster and microwave in both. Unfortunately during our stay, one of the bathrooms was out of order as they'd experienced a leak. The guy who had come out to fix it was there when we'd got there (around 1pm) and worked well into the night (9pm) but even with one bathrooms out of action, we didn't find ourselves waiting at all (Claire did inform us as soon as we'd arrived about the situation).
We had an early night as we were climbing Snowdon via the Watkin Path the following day around 7am and the track starts just 300 metres away from Red Dragon Holidays. We completed the walk and made our way back to the car but as we'd experienced a down pour on our walk back from the summit, we had a quick shower before setting off back to the West Midlands.
All in all, an amazing time and we will definitely be coming back!",5,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR
"A lovely cottage in an ideal, scenic location.","We recently enjoyed a week break at Snowdon Cottage.
We found it to be a lovely spacious cottage, filled with all the amenities you could need or want. Parking was ample, with enough room for our 4x4 and trailer for our kayaks.
The setting and location is perfect for exploring Snowdonia, and gives a nice feel of isolation without being TOO far removed from civilisation. Perfect.
The nearest village is Beddgelert, which is just under 3miles away, which has a selection of local and tourist shops, as well as a handful of pubs and placed to eat.
For supermarkets, there is a Tesco just over a 20min drive away in Porthmadog, or an ASDA and Morrison's little over 30mins away in Caernarfon.
Though maybe not to everyone's taste, I really enjoyed the lack of phone signal at the cottage. It really helps connect with the surroundings and nature without the distraction of notifications every 2 seconds.
It has to be said, that although this cottage is located very close to a path up Mount Snowdon, that path is the Watkins Path. This is known to be the hardest path up the mountain. If you're not of good/high fitness or an experienced climber, I would recommend a journey to one of the other 5 paths. The Llanberis one being the easiest (though longest), which also has a lovely railway that goes up to the summit as well.
Whilst staying here, I would also recommend a visit to the Sygun Copper Mine, which is located just under 2miles from the cottage.
All in all, a thoroughly lovely cottage in a beautiful, scenic location. Perfect for a break hiking and kayaking. If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely look to rebook.",5,,,,,,,OR
"Location, Location, Location!","I have been coming to Bryn Dinas for years. The Camping Pods are a recent addition to this brilliant little site at the foot of Snowdon. In your pod you get two comfy single beds, my friend who is a beefy 6ft 3in had no problem keeping me awake with his snoring so they are good for even the biggest adults. The pods are warm and watertight and come with electrical sockets, kettles, mugs, plates etc. There are fridges, microwaves and toaster on site and a brilliant cafe within walking distance. There are drying facilities, showers, and flush loos which are spotless!
The location is brilliant for walkers, right at the start of the Watkin Path, with a host of other walks you can do right from the door if you don't fancy Snowdon.
Clare and the rest of the team are really friendly and can't do enough to help! Thoroughly recommend this little gem to serious walkers, or those wanting to escape from the main tourist areas.

Great experience,Outstanding! Wonderful location! Close to all of the gorgeous trails! Super clean and still made you feel like you were camping! Pods were so comfortable; highly recommend if you want the full camping experience with a bit more shelter than a tent and a nice hot shower after a really long hike!,5,,,,,,,OR
Fantastic cosy place to stay very close to the Watkin Path,"The pod was perfect for a short break for my friend and I. It was clean and cosy when we arrived complete with kettle and mugs! We chose to have linen and towels provided for us and we weren't disappointed, the beds were so snug! The bathroom facilities were spotless and the showers were hot with good pressure. I really couldn't fault this place. We were climbing Mount Snowdon and the location was perfect as the site is very close to the Watkin Path. I can't wait to come back again!",5,,,5.0,,,5.0,OR
Great Stag Weekend,"We booked up all the pods for a stag party. Set up some gazebos and a BBQ and spent some amazing nights out under the stars. The pods are really comfy and make for a good social space as well.
The location is great if you are into hiking, biking etc and the walk into the village for a night at the pub is really nice now there is a dedicated trail on the far side of the lake.
Will be visiting again I hope.",5,,,,,,,OR
Cozy Cabin in a Gorgeous Location,"My family and I stayed at the cabin for 5 days. It was perfect. We did not have the best weather but that did not matter because it is situated in a beautiful location. The staff was really friendly and helpful. They have tea, coffee, sugar, milk and bread for you in the cabin when you get there and all the appliances and bits and bobs that you need to cook. Nothing was forgotten. We brought our own food and were able to keep to a budget and not eat out all the time. They have small pods as well and I believe a rental home. There are laundry facilities as well which definite come In handy when it's raining. Our cabin slept 4. We had three adults, 1 child and 2 dogs. I would definitely stay again.",5,,,,,,,OR
Hubby dog and me in a Pod!,"Just got back home from the best couple of days in Snowdonia with my lovely hubby and our 9 year old pup lol. We stayed at the red dragon Bryn Dinas Beddgelert in a pod and what a fab experience we have had . Location is fantastic just round the corner from great Snowdonia walks . The Watkin Path that goes upto Snowdon just 300 meters down the road. Beddgelert again just a couple of miles away. Bryn Dinas has everything you need the pods are so comfy, excellent showers and toilets facility and even though we only did 2 nights a place to do your laundry too x very clean and loved the fact my dog was welcome as much as us x so can't wait for next time x and this morning had the bestest breakfast at Caffi Gwynant literally 200 meters from our pod after a lovely walk around Llyn Dinas again a location you can't beat x",5,,,,,,,OR

Fabulous!,"I was a bit apprehensive about sleeping in a hut the night before we walked/climbed the Watkin Path, but I was wrong to be so. These huts are spacious, clean, warm and ours was spider free! The beds were very comfortable and the outside area accommodated our BBQ needs! The area is very quiet and I slept so well. I only wish we could have had a second night there as it was far superior to the hotel we stayed in the night after the walk. The showers and toilets were very clean and really close to the huts. Brilliant place - will visit again- highly recommended!",5,,,,,,,OR
"Fantastic location, Great accomodation perfect holiday getaway..","Stayed in the Snowdon cottage the last week of July 16' as a base to explore Snowdonia some more and trek Snowdon's Watkin path, which is so close at only 300 meters away.
The cottage was warm, bright and very welcoming apon arrival.
There was a bottle of wine, bread and milk e.t.c waiting for us which was so nice.
The large kitchen diner would be perfect for larger groups and the whole cottage was very clean, modern and spacious with everything you could need.
There are many paths and walks around and the nearby village of Beddgelert has some pubs, cafes and a few shops.
The owner was on hand to help no problem at all, even when we had a flat battery she insisted 3 hours to wait for the RAC was too long and nipped off to get some jump leads.
Within 15 mins we were going again and went for a long drive. Thanks again :)
Suggest if you take the Watkin path up Snowdon and then take a different route down afterwards ensure the buses haven't stopped; as cabs are almost impossible to get hold of and its a long walk back.
Trust us, we know,,, we did it!
All in all a great holiday in a fantastic cottage in the best place right at the bottom of the mountains.",5,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR

Incredible stay,"Amazing two night stay in the camping pods, they are warm and cosy which is perfect after the trek up mount Snowdon. The staff are lovely and friendly and have good local knowledge. The location was perfect being only 300m from a lovely cafe for breakfast and only a 5 minuet drive from the local town. The bathroom was in much better condition than what I expected with a modern fully furnished bathroom. The pods are slightly small but it was exactly what we needed and a nice step up from regular camping.",5,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR
Perfect base for your Snowdonia adventure,"What an excellent bolt hole this place turned out to be. My partner and I stayed at the Red Dragon Camping Pods during the weekend of 1st - 3rd of July as we wanted a base to explore the southern and western paths up Snowdon. Red Dragon is located a couple of hundred yards walk away from the start of the Watkin Path, possibly the most picturesque of all of the popular ascents.
It's also a couple of miles away from Beddgelert, a wonderful little village full of pubs, cafes and the superb Beddgelert Woodcrafts that we've bought many items from over the years. I would highly recommend taking the walk along Afon Glaslyn south towards Porthmadog, with such breathtaking scenery you'd swear you were in the American Rocky Mountains.
As a base for exploring Snowdonia Red Dragon was perfect for us. We usually stay in either cottages or one of our two tents, but this was something new to us and we'd been keen to try out a pod for some time. On arrival we were met by Claire who was lovely and made us feel welcome. Our pod was very inviting and was surprising warm inside. We'd brought with us sleeping bags and duvets, but as it turned out I ended sleeping on top of the bedding as the pod was so cosy.
The pod consisted of two single beds, a central beside table with lamp and kettle (along with tea/coffee/sugar/milk), a bin at the end of one bed and the heater at the end of the other. The door had a window with blind, and there was another window and curtain at the rear. Some may think that basic, but there was really nothing more needed. The toilet block was clean and of high standard, and the communal cabin housed a fridge, microwave and computer. Having access to Wi-fi (small additional cost) was excellent especially as there is no mobile/3G/4G signal at all at the site.
I'd highly recommend Red Dragon as a base for your stay in Snowdonia. We're already booked in for later in the year when I'm due to run the Snowdonia Marathon. I'm glad that I know there's a comfy bed waiting for me.",5,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,OR
3 Day Break,"My wife and I have just returned from an awesome 3 day break at the Red Dragon. What a cracking little gem this place is, tucked into the hill side of Snowdonia. We stayed in the Dragon's Lair which is a larger room than the pod's. The room was always lovely and warm and you can sleep in the beds for weeks. Claire the owner is really friendly and welcoming and makes you feel like your at home. She's really helpful and has so much knowledge in the local area.
Just across from the Camp site is a stunning lake you can walk around. And just a few metres from your front door is the start of an amazing walk up Snowdon threw a forrest path and up to some stunning water falls. We can %100 say we will be returning here as it's such a great place. And with all the surrounding beauty and great walks for you and your dogs you would be silly to not stay here and give this place a go.",5,,,,,,,OR
"Luxury camping, great for couples & families alike. Just lovely","The room was fantastic, we arrived easily due to great communication from Bryn Dinas. In all honesty we just expected beds but they have thought of everything, from corkscrews to umbrellas.
The pod was very clean and the bedding was luxurious.
The bathrooms were very spacious, much better than your usual small cubicles.
The only problem was that there aren't any local taxi firms to the village.",5,5.0,4.0,,,,,OR

"Lovely accommodation, lovely location and a warm welcome!","We had stayed in Red Dragon's Snowdon cottage for a long weekend with family back in March and were so impressed we decided to come back for 12 nights holiday in May 2016. By the time we'd decided to do so, all the cottages were booked over the middle weekend but by our request, a booking was accepted for a stay in Tryfan cottage, moving into the Maple Lodge log cabin over the weekend, then back again for our second week.
Claire was always prompt in responding to emails and extremely helpful. The details for accessing the accommodation outside of reception hours were easy to follow.
We pre-arranged to have a Tesco shop delivered on our arrival day and when we arrived it was all put away on the kitchen shelves and in the fridge which was great! There were also sweets, milk, bread and a bottle of wine as part of the welcome pack which was all very welcome.
The cottage was lovely - very homely and perfect for a couple. Importantly all their accommodation is dog-friendly. Tryfan cottage is a 2+2 with a double bedroom and a sofa bed in the lounge. We felt (as a couple) that you'd have to be pretty close friends/family to stay as a party of 4 as there's not much room aside from the bedroom and lounge/dining space. This is not a criticism - just something to be aware of! There was TV, Freeview and a DVD player and a few books on the shelves too. The kitchen and bathroom were perfectly adequate - fully stocked with crockery, cutlery etc. and also with tea towels, washing up liquid and hand soap. The bedding was very nice and there were bath and hand towels provided too.
Maple Lodge log cabin was equally as comfortable. We stayed over the weekend. All the same provisions (towels, bedding, washing stuff etc). The accommodation would be brilliant for a family wanting a camping experience without camping! There was a very comfortable double bed downstairs and a loft space upstairs which children (or big kids) would love! The bathroom and kitchen were perfectly normal facilities - just like being in a cottage! It was really cosy and comfortable.
We had wifi in both the cottage and the log cabin, although it was more reliable in the cottage as it's a dedicated connection whereas the log cabin shares its connection with the glamping pods.
Clare and the team were really helpful in moving our bags between accommodations so we didn't have any worry about packing them into the car for our 'moving' days.
There is loads to do round the area; Snowdon is on the doorstep. There's a fantastic Copper mine down the road and easy access to walks and other attractions. We also went on a boat trip to Puffin Island off Anglesey. Didn't get onto the steam railways but will plan that for our return.
I must say as well that if you're having a long stay, as we did, that the laundry facilities are excellent and very inexpensive when compared to a campsite where we've often paid three or four times what we had to to was and tumble dry clothes here.
Honestly a lovely place to stay with helpful and friendly staff running the place.",5,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,OR

Fantastic stay at Bryn Dinas!,"My partner and I had a great experience at Bryn Dinas Camping Pods. The location was ideal, a couple of minutes walk from the start of the Snowdon - Watkin path and 10 minutes drive from the Nant Peris car park. The pods were basic - clean, matresses comfortable with under bed storage, kettle, little sugars and milk pods and mugs provided plus extra plug sockets (four in total). The heating was perfect and could be turned off. Shower and bathroom facilities immaculate and well maintained. I never saw the common room to comment on that unfortunately. We took our cocker spaniel who loved it, dog attachment on pods so he could be kept on an extended lead and an area for him at the back to take to the toilet. Parking was in a verge at the side of the accommodation - cars were off the road, could be seen at all times and there was plenty of space. The lady who was at the reception (whose name I've forgotten) was extremely helpful and friendly. The site was clean, bins for rubbish and bottles present. The fridge and sink area again were immaculate and not many people used these areas, maybe because it was April and there were restaurants and cafes near by but we had a BBQ every night and It was quiet and peaceful.
The only negative was that the wifi wasn't available in our pod due to it being at the end - this made my boyfriend extremely happy! We would definitely return ",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR

Absolutely brilliant. AGAIN...!,"Having stayed at Sygun cottage Dec/Jan 2014/15, we immediately rebooked in January 2015 for New Year 2015/16, this time staying at Snowdon Cottage. What can I say? The cottage is fabulous with a lovely huge kitchen which we used as our main focal point. The underfloor heating keeps it uber cosy and the bedrooms and bathroom are gorgeous. Waking up each morning to views of the mountains is something we will never forget. Again, Claire and co had left us mince pies, sweets and wine to welcome us. The location of these cottages is perfect for a group stay. My brother and sister and their families were staying at Sygun and Tryfan and we were all able to socialise together, including walking the dogs up the Watkin Path up Snowdon. There are lovely walks all around and Bedgellert is just a 10 minute drive away. Claire and her team can't do enough to help and again, we've not only booked for New Year 2016/17, we've also booked Maple Lodge for my birthday in March 2016.

We decided to call Claire on the off chance and once again she came up with a winner. She managed to get us in the bunk house, only for 1 night but better than a cold van. Thanks Claire, you exceeded expectations once again.",5,,,,,,,OR
Christmas 2015 at Red Dragon Pods,"Thoroughly enjoyed out two night stay in ""Beaumaris"" pod over Christmas 2015.
Despite 7 inches of rain in 24 hours we had a brilliant time. The pod was clean, in great shape and incredibly well insulated and warm. We experienced brilliant, really friendly customer service from Alwen, Jason and Dina and can't wait to see you again - hopefully in snow! Paul and Tina",5,,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Fantastic!,"I am by no means a fan of camping, and do like my home comforts, so this was perfect for me. We stayed in 2 of the camping pods as a family for one night after visiting Bounce Below. We all absolutely loved it. The pods were warm and extremely comfy and the facilities available were all you could need. It was a shame it was a cold, wet October night but we are already looking into returning next summer to hopefully take advantage of bbq-ing outdoors.",5,,,,,,,OR
Maple Lodge,"My son and I have had a lovely week in the lodge. Warm and cosy set in woods that my son enjoyed exploring. Right at the start of the Watkins path and many more paths. Visited the Ffestiniog railway and national slate mine. Ideal location for any where north and such a warm welcome, we will be back again and again.",5,,,,,,,OR
Couldn't fault it!,"After a long day travelling and climbing Snowdon, this was the perfect retreat to go back to! When we arrived the key's were left in the exact place described before coming. The pods themselves were clean and tidy and along with the separate shower rooms, it made for a great stay. We didn't use the communal room (we had a few disposable BBQ's which we used outside - great idea by the way, there is a stone in the outside seating area which you can use them on!!) but it looked clean and tidy with all the facilities you could need.
I would 100% recommend Red Dragon to anybody venturing to Snowdon and I would certainly return in a heartbeat if coming back. Top stuff!",5,,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,OR

Excellent stay,"Had a wonderful stay in the pod. Was really warm and had a great nights sleep.

Will come and stay again.",5,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,OR
Glamping in Romantic Snowdon,"We booked a camping pod for the first time and this experience has really given us the great outdoors bug!
We never met our hosts however their warm and thoughtful touches were everywhere. I had asked for our beds to be pushed together and this was done so we could snuggle in our double sleeping bag. The bathrooms were spotless and the showers great - hot and with great pressure, just what you need after a day walking. All the pods are located around a small enclosure of tables and the bathrooms are very close so it is all convenient.
The pods themselves are equipped with a kettle, power and heating too so it really is glamping. There is even an umbrella in case it is raining which I am glad to say that we didn't use at all.
In the community room, there is a toaster and fridge so you can store perishables for the next day and tables so you can eat inside if the weather is not so good.
The location is great too - we were only here two days but managed to climb Snowdon (OK there was a train ride involved...), visit the beaches of Anglesey and Portmerion village too as it is all so close.
My only gripe was that our Wifi code was not left for us and I couldn't be bothered to go down the road to phone about it. There is no phone signal at this location but honestly, we were so chilled out that it was quite nice to be off grid so it wasn't a proper biggie. I am sure that if I had mentioned it, it would have been sorted out. I did pick up a BT Openzone hotspot on the first day which I connected to but it was gone on day 2.
Highly recommended - we may well be back!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
Another great stay,"Went to north wales for a week of mountain biking and tried to fit in as many trail centres as possible.
After 4 nights of sleeping in a van, we were driving past red dragon pods and decided to chance our arm and book a single nights stay.
As luck would have it, as we parked up to jot down the phone number, the owner pulled up behind us and asked if she could help. She checked her diary and told me she had a single pod left and I paid for it there and then, no hassle whatsoever.
We were only there for a single night and back out the door by 06:30 on route to Birmingham but that 1 night in a warm, dry pod, drying out damp kit was excellent.
It's our second stay there but I'd go back time and time again. I love the simplicity...",5,,,,,,,OR
A great idea and excellent customer service,"We rented 4 of these pods for the weekend and were all very pleased with them. The owners have obviously thought about their customers' needs and there was everything you needed for a comfortable stay. The pods are very warm and bedding and towels are provided. There are 2 proper bathrooms which are excellent, although there might be a wait in busy times. There's a communal room with 2 large picnic style table and chairs and a large fridge and freezer. There's a little kitchen for washing up and a microwave and another little fridge. There's also a laundry and drying room, which thankfully we didn't need to use. The pods are equipped with plates, cups, bowls and cutlery and even a couple of hot water bottles and a hair dryer! The site is lovely with loads of tables and seating areas for outside eating and drinking when the weather's good. The A5 runs right outside so you wouldn't want to let dogs or kids run around unsupervised because of the mad drivers on that road, but there's plenty of exploring area for kids well away from the road. This is an excellent alternative to camping and more fun than a B&B. We'll definitely stay here again. There's a really good cafe within walking distance too that does a great breakfast.",5,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR
Amazing!,"Fantastic stay , we stopped here for one night as the hotel we were staying at was full! We found that the facilities were much better than the hotels! And cheaper!

Brilliant Stay,"We have stayed hear twice now. Once in May in the warm log cabbing and again in August bank holiday.
The cabin had everything you needed from the kitchen work surface to the double bed and bathroom. (Space upstairs for little ones) We stayed for a week (Walking holiday) and found it was great to come back to after a cold days walking. We were greeted by a bottle of wine, chocolates and milk.
The camping pods were great as a family weekend away. They had plenty of space, Beds wee comfy and they also had plates, bowls, mugs also a hair dryer.
Thank you for a lovely stay, we will sure to be returning.",5,,,,,,,OR
Lovely little hide away,"We stayed in a pod for 3 nights, and loved it. This was our first holiday with our puppy (7 months) and he adapted to the environment really well as everyone was so friendly and the facilities were great.
Lovely cafe down the road (although it was closed mon and tues) and a few local dog walks that had lovely views.
Not far from beddgelert which had some lovely pubs which were dog friendly.
Would like to thank the staff for their helpful information, was such a relaxed place, the keys were left for us so there was no waiting around after our 6 hour drive, and the same on departure, popping the key in the post box.
Having wifi helped as we watched a movie when the bugs came out and the pods were pretty soundproof.
We had a great time and would definitely stay here again if we came back to Wales. Thumbs up",5,,,,,,,OR
Out of the rain,"During a very wet 5 days the Pods were an absolute godsend. Being able to get out of the rain into the cosy snug warm inviting pods was fantastic. Good shower blocks with very warm water, great drying facilities for wet clothes with washing machines and tumble dryers and kitchen facilities all on site. Due to weather wasn't able to use the giant bean bags or bar-b-q's but could imagine on a sunny evening they would be fantastic. Local village Beddgelert about 2.8 miles away with a few great pubs serving great food. Right in the foothills of Snowdon and nearby mountain biking available as well. A wonderful glam ping trip that I would highly recommend.",5,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,OR
Perfect end to a perfect trip,"Decided with a small group that we wanted to go to Snowdon and take the challenge of the climb, needed to find somewhere close by to the walk and we didn't want to have to put tents up as we didn't know how long the hike would take so was delighted to find these camping pods , they were clean , very practical , very comfortable and cosy after a long hike .

Great few days away,"First time glamping.
Wasn't disappointed.
Warm friendly welcome before we had even arrived.
Pods warm and cosy with everything you need right down to a hairdryer.
Don't be put off by the closeness of the other pods. It didn't bother us one bit.
Lovely warm bathrooms, excellent laundry facilities and bike storage.
A great few days away and the dog came too !

brilliant little place to stay,"great little camping pod site. access easy even though we turned up late. fresh bedding in place and about 10 steps from the shower and toilet block. shower and toilet block was spotless and showers powerful and hot. good stock of toilet rolls.

Cozy,"We have stayed at the pods a few times and will be returning again next week, the team who look after the guests are wonderful. There is nothing missing from a stay here, clean shower n toilets, a kitchen and somewhere to seat inside if need be with a computer to use. There is wifi in the pods ay a cost of only £2 pre night.

the pod,"Better than a tent, all the basics for a campsite, the bed was comfortable and once it was moved away from the wall I slept better for not hitting the wall every time I turned over in bed. showers lovely and strong, hot and clean..I was there at a 'quiet' time, but I would think when it's busy- busy then 2 toilets only for the whole 5 pods, cabin and Den would be a bit tricky as the toilets are in each of the 2 shower rooms.....quite a wait with legs crossed it would seem....disappointed I couldn't get internet connection on my laptop, I got it once but it didn't last, having to use site 'puter a life-saver, but again 'quiet time' so it was available. staff nice and friendly and helpful, but having someone come onsite at 6:30 a.m one morning doing jobs e.g. sawing wood, hammering etc etc waking folks up was not appreciated, a car is a deffo unless you are an avid walker, bus to town 2 hourly intervals,and last bus back 4pm- ish.....I fine tuned the walk from Beddgelert to Pod down to 1 hour (2.5 miles) had I stayed longer I would p'raps have got it better.....it's deffo for camping and not glamping, but overall I really enjoyed my escape to the 'wilds'..eat your heart out Bear Grylls.....lovely area, lovely people...many thanx Claire and staff xx",5,,5.0,,4.0,4.0,,OR

Glan Dinas,"We stayed in this house for a long weekend. The house is clean and really well equipped and has lots of room. There is plentiful hot water and central heating (yes, in July!) and a log fire. Beds are comfortable, and there is lots of space to relax after a hard day playing out in Snowdonia. There is garden furniture and a couple of swings in the garden ( if the weather is kind!). Wifi is available (£5 charge), which is useful as there is no mobile phone signal.
A nice touch was the bread, milk and bottle of wine that was waiting for us on arrival.
Parking is in the lay-by opposite the house, which is large enough for 3 - 4 cars. The village of Beddgelert, with restaurants and pubs, is 10 minutes drive away.
There are bats in the roof, which are fascinating to watch at dusk. A walk up Snowdonia is a must if you are fit enough, and the Zip Wires at Blaenau Ffestiniog are great fun.
We would definitely stay here again.",5,,,,,,,OR

Great value for money,"We chose this location as part of a short break in North Wales purely on cost as we were looking to get away for a few days during the half term holidays and everywhere else would have cost us around the £500 - £600 so we did 2 nights in the pods and 2 nights elsewhere in a shepherds hut and in total it cost us less than £200 - The pod itself was ideal for us and our 2 little dogs, they were clean and warm and the beds were comfortable, the shower block was very clean and warm there was also an area for basic cooking with a microwave, a toaster, a kettle and fridge for you to use and next to that a washing up area, there was also a laundry room and coat / boot drying room too, there is seating in front of the pods and giant bean bags also cooking areas in front of the pods for BBQ.
During our stay there were in total 3 dogs who were very well behaved and quiet which is more than can be said for the children who were staying there at the same time !!!
We really enjoyed our stay at the pods and would definately return again - the one thing to point out though is that there is no phone signal at the pods (which in my opinion isn't a bad thing) but you can have wifi so not all is lost.",5,,5.0,5.0,,,,OR

The shower bloke is clean and heated .
There was a toaster, microwave and fridge to use.
We enjoyed sitting out side on the large beanbags and a BBQ, we did miss a campfire but this did not spoil out stay. I will be booking again and can recommend this to anyone who likes the outdoors as well as comfort.

Quality huts,My partner and I rolled up on our motorbikes to find a little village of camping pods. Warm comfy with all mod cons. A clean and warm shower toilet block. A kitchen with microwave toaster and washing facilities. A community room with internet books mags etc the list goes on and on. A great place in Wales to stay. Our only minor criticism is there is no fire pit to warm you while you watched the shooting stars.,5,,,,,,,OR
Great base,We stayed here in the pods for my son's birthday to access some local attractions such as bounce below. A perfect base that is ideal for exploring area and loved the café down the road.

Cosy!,"Me and my partner stayed in one of these camping pods for only one night. Even though it was just one day we had an amazing time!
Claire was great through the booking process, which got a bit complicated as I needed to change the date more than once. She was helpful and answered all my emails and questions promptly.
Arriving could not have been easier, the keys were exactly where she said they would be and it was so hassle free.
The pod itself was clean and spotless and had much more room then I thought they would have. The bedding was comfy and cosy, and fluffy towels were provided. There was a kettle in the room with tea and coffee, which was great.The bathroom was lovely! I didn't expect it to be so nice. The facilities were great, and the location is amazing. The surrounding area is breath-taking.
I really could not recommend it enough!",5,,,,,,,OR
Had an amazing time in snowdon cottage!,"After a four hour journey the cottage was was an amazing place to recuperate and prepare for our hike up the watkin path, we were greeted with wine, milk and a loaf of bread, the cottage has a beautiful garden and pretty much every facility you could possibly require. It was a bit of a tardis and our group of seven fitted In perfectly. Amazing views, a A large and very well equipped kitchen, very powerful shower and the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The closest supermarket is nine miles away in Porthmadog and phone reception was practically non existent so this really is a retreat from the outside world! Can't wait to book it again!",5,,,,,,,OR

Ideal for Snowdon,"4 friends and one little dog stayed in 2 camping pods (I have stayed before and pleased to be offered a returners discount for the group!) for 2 nights for a hike up Snowdon.

We even utilised the very thoughtful hot water bottles :-) however there is heating, plus power points, no need to even get out of bed for a morning cuppa as the kettle is within reach and all tea bags, coffee, milk etc are provided. Will stay again!",5,,,,,,,OR
A snug port in a storm!,"What an awesome little bolt-hole for our (unsuccessful) hike up Snowdon. Rather unfortunate that the only parking available is on the roadside, and that the site itself is just feet away from the main road. However, during our visit at least, this was not a major issue as traffic was minimal and there was very little noise. The only thing that hindered our sleep was the light from the communal area/reception cabin which is left on all night (this was easily sorted by flinging our towels over the curtain rail, although blackout linings for the curtains wouldn't go a miss!). The pod and surroundings were clean, cosy and impeccably presented, with a wealth of information left for us in a neat folder on the bed (with plenty more available in the reception cabin,",5,,,,,,,OR
Perfect for quick getaway,"I stayed here for a quick solo 2 day trip- the pod was awesome, warm and the facilities were great too. Nice hot shower, community room, picnic area, wifi.
Did some big runs and just slouched in the big outdoor bean-bags drinking beer in the evening... perfect!
Nice welcome, perfect location at the foot of the Watkins path up Snowdon. The only potential issue could be the close quarters if you had noisy people for neighbors, but not in my case!",5,,5.0,,,5.0,4.0,OR
Booked to return almost as soon as we got home...!!!,"We stayed at Sygun cottage between Christmas and New Year 2014. We were welcomed warmly when we arrived, and entered the cottage to find mince pies, sweets and a bottle of wine. They'd also lit the Xmas tree for us. It's ideally situated for walking up Snowdon or along the lake to Beddgelert. The cottage was so cosy with the wood burner lit, and the kitchen was perfectly well equipped for cooking meals. This cottage has 2 bedrooms and each has it's own en suite, which is ideal when there's 4 adults sharing. I can't recommend this accommodation highly enough. We've booked to return for this Xmas/New Year, but are staying in Snowdon this time. Though my brother and his family have booked into Sygun and my sister and her family are booked into Tryfan.

A warm welcome stay at Snowdon Cottage,"This is the umteenth time I've (we've) stayed with Red Dragon but the first time in Snowdon Cottage.
There were five of us and we all fitted in perfectly. Heating is awesome (which is lovely in the depths of a miserable UK winter) with the bonus of under floor heating! A large kitchen set the scene for a gathering point on all nights and with plenty of room for food etc it was perfectly homely for all our needs.
You really can't fault Red Dragon's location. The legendary Watkins Path is within couple hundred meters from your doorstep. Cnicht and the Molwyns are a beautiful view from the yard and the regular visits of mountain goats into the garden are rather quaint.
Good access to all Snowdonia's walks, scrambles and climbs means this is a must for couples and groups alike.
Claire (the owner) is always on hand to help out with things and I've never had any bother with this.
I think the only place I've not stayed in now is Maple Cottage . . . .",5,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,OR
Faultless,The pods themselves were clean and the beds and bedding really comfortable. The 2 shower rooms were also cleaned daily and the showers were powerful and really hot- perfect after a day climbing snowdon. Staff were really friendly and helpful. A 5 minute drive from the beautiful picturesque village of bed gelled and a 1 minute walk from the Watkins path up to snow don. Probably a more advanced walk than the normal Pyg track route. A lovely 4 night stay- I will definitely be going back.,5,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,OR

Claire kindly let us in the pod early and gave us our pre ordered packed lunch before we set off to the forest bike track in Beddgelert . Once we got back the pod was fantastic with the deluxe pack we had requested ( duvet / double pillows and wifi ) well worth the uplift in cost . The showers were really warm and the pod was warm overnight and very cosy . The nearby converted chapel café was perfect as was v close access to the Watkins path .
Would highly recommend staying here .",5,,,,,,,OR
Ideal for a Snowdon winter trek,"Arrived on Boxing Day after a 7 hour drive from Cornwall to find a well kitted out 2 man pod ready with tea and coffee making facilities and the heater cranked up. What more could you need at 9pm in the snow. Comfy beds although we used sleeping bags to keep costs down which was fine. Comfy beds and good hot shower facilities and wifi provided at £2 per night. Overall an excellent base for any adventure on the mountains. Only negatives were the road noise (we were located in the pod next to road). Wifi didn't work in our pod due to distance from hub possibly and needs a few more hooks inside the pod to hang your gear.
All that aside, I'd highly recommend it to anyone who looking for basic accommodation with a few added extras all at a good price. I'm hoping to return in the summer and next winter. 10/10.",5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,OR

Perfect for Snowdon Walking Trip,"Stayed in the Red Dragon pods with the family for one night prior to a Snowdon walk - two teenagers in one, my wife and I in the other. The pods are very clean, well equipped, warm and very comfortable. The shower block is adjacent, as is the small kitchen area. Both were clean and well-equipped, with plenty of hot water. For a reasonably priced overnight stop it was perfect and the location is ideal for any of the Snowdon routes. Parking is on the verge (see photo) but even with all the pods booked, there was no problem with parking. The site is next to the road, but the road is very quiet and we were not bothered by traffic noise at any time whilst we were there. Booking was very easy and although we didn't meet Claire, as we arrived late and left early, all her arrival instructions were very clear, and there are comprehensive information folders with information on the accommodation itself and things to do in the local area. The pods are just something a little different from the normal B&B or camping and as a family we certainly enjoyed it. I'd highly recommend it and will definitely return.",5,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,OR
Red Dragon pods -walking trip,"This was my second visit to Red Dragon Pods. We chose it again as we were so pleased the first time round and it was perfect starting place for our walk up Snowdon via the Watkins Path.

There were 6 of us, 3 returning for the second time, and were all happy with the shower block -clean and lots of hot water.

Excellent weekend,"Amazing camping pods, we didn't want to leave. The staff are really friendly and helpful also. Have already recommended to friends and would definitely stay here again!!

Homely little cottages!,"Group of around 20 of us stayed in these cottages/cabins weekend of 11th-13th July for a hen do. I was in Arran cottage and it was lovely, very spacious and instantly homely. It was really clean and all a group of ladies needed for a good weekend! The area was lovely and quiet (except perhaps us in the evenings!) and it was a perfectly comfortable night sleep, though very unusual waking up to the sound of sheep being townies! Beddgelert is a lovely little village to visit, and we also travelled out to Betws y Coed with some stunning views en route. Would recommend these cottages to anybody wanting any type of break - though be warned there isn't a cashpoint local and the nearest supermarket is about 9 miles away so come prepared!
Also - no phone reception though wifi can be purchased for the duration of your stay. Would happily return again ",5,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR
Brill experience!,"We have just come back from a night staying in the Conway castle pod with a 4 mnth old and a dog, brill experience, something we will remember.
Staff are really helpful, facilities are exactly what we needed, pod was warm and clean. Have already recommended to a number of friends. Thanks guys!!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,OR
Great fun and ideal for the Snowdon climb,"I visited these pods a couple of weeks ago with 4 work mates for one of their stag do's.
We took our own beer and food for the evening and sat around a BBQ.
The next morning we walked to the foot of Snowden for our 4 hour hike up Mt. Snowdon.
It's a great alternative stag night and beats the usual boring pub crawl (ok I'm not in my 20-30's these days lol).
Thanks to NH for organising the trips for ""The boyo's "" and good luck Pazza for your forthcoming wedding.
Highly recommended .",5,,,,,,,OR
Great outdoor experience,"We stayed in one of the 'pods' (Beamauris Castle), it was a spare of the moment trip and owner Claire was very accommodating. The pods are well equipped, comfortable & it's not in your pod chances are you'll have access to what you need in communal areas throughout the camp. We shall hope to return again soon, we're glad that we've found somewhere we can escape too, even if may be only for a night or two. Snowdonia is truly stunning, we've got some more exploring to do. Thanks Claire!",5,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,OR
Stayed the end of June.,"Very pleased with our stay. Was met by Claire the owner with a very warm welcome. The pods were clean and comfortable with tea making facilities, hot water bottles and hair dryers which was a nice touch. The showers and WC were very clean with very hot water. The kitchen was well equipped even with wine classes and a fridge that all the guests used. Met up with the other guests in the evening and made new friends. You will need bug spay if sitting out in the evening and give you pod a spray before you go to bed. The location is spot on with the start of the Watkins walk up snowdon. The site was very close to the road which I thought it would be a problem but was very quiet in the evening. The next village had lots of restaurants a small village shop. Over all a good stay and will be going back.",5,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,OR
Super pods,Stayed here in the pods last weekend with my 9 year old son and thought it was top quality. Great location next to the watkins path for snowdon and only a short drive from beddgelert. The pods were clean tidy and really comfortable. Wifi a real added bonus as no mobile network. Other facilities including shower rooms and kitchenette were of a good standard. The owner Clare was really helpful and welcoming. I wouldn't hesitate to return as it certainly beats pitching a tent.,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,OR
Great value venue and brilliant service by the owners,Great place if you want to do some walking and enjoy the isolation this area offers - thanks to no mobile coverage. Bring what you need in terms of food and drinks and you have all the facilities needed to keep you happy. Great service and will look to do another group trip again soon. Only tip is bring some repellant as plenty of bites on certain days and great cafe a 5 minute walk away for breakfast or lunch.,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,OR
Fantastic!,"We walked Snowdon for charity (3 of us). The pods are very clean and comfy, the beds are great and just what you need after a tough day!

Would come here again!,"What can I say - brilliant! This was the most ideal place for our stay (8 friends climbing Snowdon) We stayed in the pods & they were great. Clean, comfy beds with tea & coffee making facilities. Even a little hair dryer for each pod! The toilet/showering facilities were clean and the showers powerful - better than I've seen on many camping blocks. Also Claire made us all a packed lunch, which was delicious and well enjoyed at the top of Snowdon. All in all well done and would strongly recommend to anybody.",5,,,,,,,OR
Fantastic pods,"Stayed 2 nights in the end pod nearest the road, at first I thought it was going to be noisy but as the evening went on I didn't notice the traffic at all, Pod was great, plenty of storage under the bed, surprisingly warm as I have stayed in pods on other sites and felt the cold. Showers were fantastic and clean, communal room well equipped with a great collection of books and magazines, a large fridge freezer and a computer . Only minor negative, the light outside the door although great, it does light up the pod at night and the blind didn't block it out, solved problem by hanging towel up over the window . Highly recommend the site, a great base for exploring snowdonia, couple of miles from beddgelert . And will definatly go back",5,,,,,,,OR
Expectations exceeded,"Went for one night in a pod with my 3 year old son. We both had a ball. The pods are ideal, cozy and surprisingly spacious inside, with plenty of storage in the bed bases. I requested a breakfast which was fantastic, there was too much to choose from. I will be going back soon and highly recommend any of the accommodation on site, but the pods were a real adventure.",5,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,OR
Eco-pod tastic,"Red Dragon is situated in a quiet spot between Beddgelert village and the Pen-Y-Gwyrd Hotel, your own transport is essential and sat nav required if you are unfamiliar with the area. The reason to be in the area is Snowdon and the scenery is magnificent the accommodation was a bonus. The pods are small containing two single beds and some coffee/tea facilities but warm, clean, and with great bedding. The toilets and shower facilities are a few steps from your room - could be a bit chilly at night - with on site washing and dryer machines. There is a communal area with Wi-Fi and also a BBQ area which could be fun in the evening if you are with a group. I was travelling solo and up with the larks so did not have much contact with the owners but it was apleasure to stay and the Red Dragon and I would happily stay there again.",5,4.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Fantastic,"Me and my partner had an amazing time staying here, pods were really cozy and situated in a beautiful place.

Amazing,"Just returned from 2 nights pod camping at Red Dragon. Everything about this place was brilliant. Well equipped from heaters to hot water bottles, clean powerful hot showers, tea and coffee making in each pods and good quality bedding. Claire was so accommodating and makes a wicked packed lunch, perfect for the top of Snowdon!
We were a group of 8 so had 4 of the pods but the communal area was great and this location fitted our trip perfectly. Marvellous weather helped!
Thanks Claire and team",5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,OR
Fantastic!,"Just got back from a very (very) wet weekend hiking in Beddgelert.
As a group of 10 friends we booked all five pods.
From start to finish Claire (the owner) was exceptional.
The pods were spotless and toasty warm. The showers and toilet block were also spotless. When we arrived we were able to put our beers and food in the large fridge and off we went.
After an accent of Snowdon (the Watkin path is right on your doorstep) we got back to the pods soaking wet. The showers were all piping hot and the drying room was a god send as was the tumble dryer (£1).
As the rain continued into the evening we were able to use the fantastic Community room and had a BBQ on the terrace.
The pods were fantastic to sleep in (we opted for the pod package). Very warm and comfy beds with tea and coffee making facilities - and a hot water bottle!
Although close to the road it is very quiet in the evening and you forget it's there.
All in all, a great experience, a fantastic location and we can't wait to come back - although hopefully with better weather next time!",5,,,,,,,OR
Great little adventure base,Very helpful and very friendly. Great location for getting out into the countryside to hike and climb. The pods were much more well equipped than I had expected: a kettle and a hairdryer make any camping trip better! Also surprisingly spacious whilst still cozy and well insulated.,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Lovely relaxing weekend break,"We stayed here over the early Bank Holiday in May. Claire was so helpful with the booking process and also when we arrived on site.
The cabins are lovely and warm and have everything you need, the single beds are a winner.
Only suggestion I could make would be as others have said a mirror in the pod, so you can dry your hair.
Showers were clean and warm. Small drying room on site, washing up facilities, fridge, microwave etc.
We will definately be returning!
Don't worry about the close proximity of the road, once in bed we barely heard it.",5,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,OR
Amazing!!!,"I stayed in the Camping Pods for 1 night with my best friend as part of my 30th Birthday!!! When we arrived we were surprised by how close it was to the roadside but it was an absolutely amazing stay!!!! (was quiet even though it was on roadside - so no sleep disturbances)
From the minute I made the booking, it all ran smoothly - Claire from red dragon was very helpful.
The Camping Pods, we booked the luxury package and it was fabulous! The pods are a lot bigger than they seem from the outside, very clean and everything we needed was there for us! The beds were really comfy and clean. The communal bathrooms were spot on too, very clean and accessible - everything we needed was there.
Its only a 5-6min drive from Beddgelert and there are lots to see there and shops/pubs
We only stayed 1 night but it was amazing, and really enjoyed it and I would have no quarms in staying again and for even longer - it would so amazing in the summertime too, especially with a group of friends.
I am so happy I came across red Dragon on the internet and booked. It really made the end of my 30th birthday amazing, I would highly recommend to anyone!!!
Great for families, friends, special occasions or to just get away from the hustle and bustle (there is NO signal on the site so no mobile usage, but being from a city it was a nice change)",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Brilliant bed in Brilliant place,With a heavily pregnant wife couldn't do our usual wild camp and needed a propper bed on short notice had some availability and couldnt ask for a better base to start out from and with the cafe up the road it made the catering even easier. lovely bed lovely setting lovely wild goats to make it feel lie camping,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Felt at home,"Superb cottage, great location. 10 of us stayed for the weekend and there was loads of space. Went walking on snowdon, ideal base for exploring the area. We will defiantly be back. Owners could not do enough to make you feel at home.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,OR
A perfect base to explore snowdon,"Stayed here for 4 nights over the easter bank holdiay, lovely place to stay the pods themselves were very well equpped with hot water bottles, tea and coffee making, hairdryer, plates and cuttlery... surprisingly warm even without the heating on, would of beed useful to have a mirrior hung on the wall in the pod to really finish them off.
All the communal faciaitlies were very clean, and the showers were nice powerful and hot, the huge beannags were a good touch as are the little hooks for dog leads outside on each of the pods. In the toilet/shower bloack there are 2 rooms each having a toilet, shower and sink and mirror in some respects it would of been nice for the showes and toilet to be in seprate rooms as can mean they get quite busy as peak times, on other hand rooms they were in were nice and big and also had heated towel rails.
We didnt get to met the owner Clare due to the time we arrived and left, however customer service during booking was very polite and friendly and always quick to respond.
If i was heading back to snowdon would defintely check out your avialbility before looking elsewhere.
Only downside could be the proximity of the pods to each other, wasnt a problem for us as we had lovely neighbours during our stay.

Great place; but...,"I've been to Snowdon countless times (probably walked up it on 15 separate occasions) and only just managed to stumble upon this little place. The pods are made up of two full size twin beds and just about enough floor place for third person in a sleeping bag on the floor in between which the owners do not mind. Splitting the cost between three people is great value for money. The showers were hot and the shower room itself warm, although on of them was a bit slow to drain. The pods were very cosy especially on a rainy day. The kitchen area is small but has everything you need: sink, microwave and fridge. It also has clean towels which the owners replace every day. There is also a communal area with a computer connected to the internet which is free to use along with maps of the area to browse around. What I like most about this place is the cleanliness and the giant bean bags to laze around it. Also, the nearest pub is about 10 minutes drive away.
All in all, a great place and we will be returning. However, I should point out that the pods are right next to a main road so it can get a little noisy in the morning. It would have been perfect if the pods were set back in the woods a bit further but I guess it wasn't possible for the owners to do this.",5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Fantastic Place to Stay,"This bank holiday weekend, we stayed for 2 nights and was very impressed, the pods are very clean (and cute) and have everything you need and more, its the fun of camping but warm and dry.... Facilities at Red Dragon were great, showers were excellant clean and warm and all other facilities were also more than expected for the great price... (even supplied hot water bottle) perfect spot to start walking up to Snowdon and away from the crowds... I will definantly be returning and recommending to family & friends xxx Well done to Claire such a great place to stay",5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,OR
Fabulous Way to go Camping,"Did 2 nights in 2 pods with my daughter & her boyfriend. The pods are clean, warm & cosy. The ablution facilities are clean with plenty of hot water. I had no preconceived ideas about this type of holiday but we had a fabulous time and we were blessed with fabulous weather! We climbed Snowdon which is literally up the road, walked amongst spectacular countryside & caught the Ffestiniog steam train into Porthmadog & lunched round the harbour in the sunshine! Would DEFINATELY go again! What a find!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Excellent accommodation for a stay near Snowdon,"I stayed for 2 nights in mid-March with a friend. The Pods are in a great location for Snowdon and the surrounding countryside. The facilities were very clean and tidy. The pods were warm with electric heating and lights. The power sockets were useful for charging various devices during the trip. The beds were comfortable with a cover sheet, pillow and pillow-case provided. There was also storage under the bed and hooks on the wall for coats, etc. The in-pod coffee and tea making facilities were of great use with some coffee, tea and milk provided. The shower and toilet facilities were clean and a big relief after a day mountain biking. We paid extra for Wi-Fi which was essential as there was no phone signal. There is also a payphone in the communal area if you are without a mobile. I cooked on a camping stove and my friend used the microwave provided. The pot washing facility was great with sponges, washing-up liquid and tea towels also provided.
Our stay at Bryn Dinas Camping Pods was great and I hope to book for a stay with my wife sometime in the future. I would recommend the site to anyone.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Great stay,"This was my 2nd stay at red dragon. Brilliant time again - the pods were lovely and warm and the beds, lights and electricity made it a very civilised type of camping. A welcome pack of coffee/teas/milk is also provided. The place is dog friendly and is by lots of walks. Will definitely be going back!",5,,,,,,,OR
Great winter camping,"My brother and I booked a camping pod at Red Dragon, and were really impressed with the place. We were the only ones there (we booked on a weekend that a storm was due!), but I can imagine the place has a great sense of community when full.
The facilities were spotless and extremely well equipped. The pod itself was dry, warm, surprisingly spacious, and a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I can't fault a single part of my stay at all, and will be staying again soon.
The pods are a great idea and I'd recommend them to anyone who enjoys a break that's a bit different.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR
Brilliant idea for camping in Winter,"I booked a cottage and 3 pods for a large group of walkers, and they were perfect for our needs.

Worth every penny,"Ideal year round camping destination! Great location, just a two minute walk to the foot of the 'Watkin Path' and a five minute drive to pen-y-pass. It's well worth the five hour drive up from Guildford. Already looking forward to my next visit in a few weeks.

Spotless site in a beautiful setting with everything you need at a price that is right.,"As a family we love camping and have all the equipment required for a camping. The downside is camping isn't much fun in winter months. We wanted a night away without the kids but wanted the camping experience that we love. After searching many sites we found the lovely pods at red dragon. Prices were no more expensive than what we would normally pay for a camping pitch. We were unsure of what to expect but What an absolute pleasant supprise.
The pods were spotless and warm and the location is simply beautiful. The facilities onsite were probably the best we have seen on a small site to date (and we have stayed at many).
The weather was what to be expected in January, cold and wet. This didn't matter at red dragon. Warm and toasty pods and a brilliant community room where we spent the evening playing cards.
We can't wait to return. Well done Claire, there isn't one negative!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,OR
Delivering quality accommodation time and time again,"My wife and I (and friends) have stayed at Red Dragon several times in the past. I think I've managed to stay in every one of their accomodations at some point (apart from Maple Lodge).
The amount of time and effort these guys have put into making this place warm, comforting and welcoming is unbelievable. And they are striving to make things even better!!!!
We stayed in one of their pods this time. Love them. As pods go, warm, with electricity, lighting, plug sockets, comfortable beds, linnen and room enough to store kit. This is something you rarely see with eco pods so at the price they charge - I reckon it's a bargain.
And - on top of that you have instantly hot power showers and clean toilets. You also have a seperate community hut/room with a computer to use, maps, tables, fridge and tea making facilities (also in the pod). Pluse laundry facilities, microwave and drying facilities. All of this nested sweetly in sight of Cnicht and the surrounding hills.
And if you're STILL unsure . . . the famous Watkins path starts only couple hundred meters away.
Would we come again - stupid question. Of course we would. Time and time again. This is an ideal strategic point to start any Snowdonia adventures.
Thanks Claire et al - for delivering quality accommodation time and time again. You'll be hearing from me soon for more bookings",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR

Wow!!!

Fantastic hosts...Claire couldn't have been more helpful...personal touches like the complimentary bottle of wine and card for our wedding anniversary made it that extra bit special...could easily keep this place quiet...but would like to shout it from te mountains...it's AMAZING!!! Loved it!!! Loved it!!! Loved it!!!,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,OR
"Overall, a comfy and pleasant stay in a great location","Upon arrival at the pod site, Claire greeted us and explained where all the amenities were located on site. The site is small but has a kitchen area which comprises of a hut separated by a wall: one side contains the microwave, toaster and work top area, the other side contains the sink. The toilets are situated in another hut and are located in a room with a shower and sink like a proper bathroom. There is also a laundry room with a washer and dryer.
In the pod itself, coffee, tea and a kettle are provided as well as a small selection of cutlery and plates in the bedside table/box. We forgot our bed linen so en route phoned to ask if we could have bed linen provided, this wasn't a problem and when we arrived at the pod, it had all been laid out ready for us.
The location is good if you want to climb snowdon, it's a 5 minute drive up the road. We also found a great cycle route at the Beddgellert forest. That was also a 5 minute drive. Beddgellert itself is a 5 minute drive and there are a few places to eat but beware, most stop serving around 8-8:30pm. Saracens head serves til 9pm and the food there is fab.
There are no disappointing elements to this accommodation, the only thing I would say is, be prepared to share your personal space with creepy crawlies. I have a serious phobia of spiders and my nerves were stretched to the limit because they're everywhere you turn. I was told that there a 6 weeks of the year that they are immensely prevalent and the time we went was around week 4 so this may not be an issue any other time.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,OR
Cosy pods- will be booking again,"Stayed in the new camping pods at this site. There are 5 camping pods, each with 2 single beds and have small bedside table with kettle. Very cosy and much comfier than camping! The toilets were less than 10 metres away, and consisted of 2 self contained shower/toilet/ sink. Showers were very good- nice and hot with good power. The pods even came with a large umbrella to save you getting wet if it was raining. There was also 3 cottages and 1 log cabin on site. Site was very dog friendly and the owner even heled remove a tick off my dog!
Location was brilliant- about 3 miles to nearest village Bedgellert either via footpath or 2 miles via road. Lots of pubs/ cafes in Bedgellert and also a good cafe 300m down the road from site. This was also the start of a footpath up Snowdon. If this footpath was too challenging there are lots of nice low level walks around the area.
I would probably not recommend the site to people with young children as it was on a fast road and was also in woodlands so some rough ground and drops but children over about 7 would have a great time playing in the area.
Would definitely recommend it and will be going again",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,OR

Improvements required -
Light in the washing up area as very dark at night
Blind to window of the bathroom
Lock sorted on the bathroom door as very very hard to lock the door
Light sensor in actual bathroom not just by main door. Light goes off leaving you in pitch black unable to get light on or see anything.
Lighting along walkway past bathroom block as it was pitch black and hard to see walkway edges.

Red Dragon Revisited,"We were looking for a very last minute stay on our way home and were lucky to get the last free pod.
Pods are functional and cosy. A pillow and bottom sheet is provided and we took sleeping bags. 
You can book bedding for an additional cost. Tea and coffee making facilities are available in the pods too. 
Two single beds make the most of the space.
The owner reserved parking for us which was much appreciated as we weren’t arriving until later. Dog friendly spot too. If you’re looking for a timber tent in a fantastic location for a night or two this place is perfect.",4,,,,,,,OR

Glamping in Snowdonia,"Lovely little camping pods in the most beautiful location. Very clean, great facilities and attention to detail. Great shower! Very near two lakes which are amazing for swimming, and several great hikes. They're taking Covid-19 very seriously and have all procedures in place. I would only say the beds aren't super comfortable if you are a larger adult, and because you're in the forest the midges are incessant in the evenings, so bring bug spray/citronella to keep them at bay. A lovely place all round!",4,,,,,,,OR
Great Holiday,"Me and my partner visited recently and arrived late at night. The pod was easy to find only a short walk away from the car. The pod was also lovely and warm when we entered with fresh linen on the bed. It's set in a great location which is a few minutes from the start of the watkin path to the peak of snowden. There is also a cafe a minutes walk away which does amazing food. Overall very happy with our visit, the only reason for a 4 rating was that the showers weren't working when we first arrived but after letting Claire know they were fixed promptly. Showers were clean and exactly what we needed after a day of hiking",4,,,,,,,OR
Cmfortable pods with great access to Snowdon,"I stayed for 3 nights this November and was the only guest, so it was very quiet. The booking process was efficient and check-in very straightforward. The Pod was clean and comfortably furnished with a little electric heater that kept it nice and warm. All the facilities were clean and as described on the website.Easy access to Watkin Path for Snowdon. If all the pods were occupied I think the bathrooms, kitchenette and washup could easily be overcrowded. The pods are quite near he road so expect some traffic noise. Not a problem in November.",4,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,,OR
Perfect for hiking,"A very cute and cosy accommodation, great access to Watkin path and bus to Pen-y-pass plus a two minute walk to one of the best cafes in Snowdonia - Caffi Gwynant!
Only gripe is that the pod felt a little damp for various understandable reasons. Although the pod does have heating and the showers are amazing!",4,,,,,,,OR
Very spacious and comfortable cottage,"8 of us stayed here for a family break and it was ideal in terms of location for Snowden and the Zip World centres. The village is lovely and there were plenty of very good places to eat.
The cottage is very well equipped for self catering and the rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms spotless and modern.
There is a communal cabin with tables and chairs where WiFi works better.
We would recommend staying here as it was very good value for money and comfortable.",4,,,,,,,OR
Beautiful place to stay,"A great place to lay your head after exploring the hills and beauty og Snowdonia and Beddgelert. Great facilities onsite, with bathrooms, kitchenette and a community room along with cosy pods with great views at a good price.",4,,,,,,,OR
Great Almost-Camping Experience,"This place is a great alternative to camping. The location is great for hiking around Snowdon, we even did a nice little walk to nearby Beddgelert which is adorable. The pods are nice, and stayed very warm during our October stay. The toilets are very nice and clean and the washing machine was a great addition. Unfortunately I have a bad back and did not realize the beds in the pods were foam pads. Knowing this I would come prepared with more padding next time, and would happily stay here again.",4,5.0,,,4.0,,3.0,OR
Great overnight stay,"We stayed here in October just as a stop off before we climbed Snowdon.
These pods are a great idea, there was three of us so we stayed in a larger room. There isn't a ton of space, only one person at a time can really manoeuvre around but once we'd worked that out it wasn't a huge issue.
I'm not a fan of communal toilets so that was the only downside for me but it's not the sort of venue where you have an ensuite! My brother booked the pods so I wasn't fully aware of what to expect until I got there!
It's in a beautiful area, the road is quiet at night time and we all slept really well.
I would definitely stay again if I was in the area!",4,,,,,,,OR
Nearly perfect,"This is our first time staying in a camping pod and we wanted a night in Snowdonia rather than travelling to/from home each day, There was myself, my wife and our dog.

As there were no pods available we were offered the bunk room which afforded us more space and I thought this was a nice gesture.

The location is amazing, close to two lakes and a few miles takes you into Beddgelert.

What we loved:

We had a great nights sleep
The bunk room was great, space to keep bags and a small dog crate
Fantastic views
Kettle and microwave for making a brew and warming up food
Community room was great with maps, leaflets and a laptop
Plenty of bathrooms, warm and powerful showers, heated towel rail and bath mats.
What we feel could be improved:
There are spoons and forks but no knives
Providing a few plates / bowls would have been appreciated
There were wine glasses in the room but no tumblers
Staff ranged from friendly to indifferent, the person whom I handed the key to on the final day - how about asking how was your guests stay or saying goodbye. Small touches mean a lot!
There was lots about this place we loved but it felt like it just needs a few tweaks to be perfect. I'd say the biggest is providing a few basics for the guests as going off the website it isn't always clear what you do or do not need to bring. There are cups for a hot drink but not a plate to put your food on. Most definitely is to ensure all of the staff on site make your guests feel valued and welcomed, it's a basic of hospitality. We left without feeling welcome or encouraged to return.
That said I would stay here again just for the comfort and the location, everywhere we wanted to go to was under an hour away including trips to Anglesey, Abersoch and Barmouth.",4,,2.0,5.0,,,5.0,OR
Couple days in Snowdonia,"Red Dragon camping pods or Bryn Dinas Glamping as it's also called was a delight. Excellent location right at the foot of Snowdon and a quirky little pod with a comfy bed, clean showers & toilets and a BBQ area if you don't want to eat out all the time.",4,,,,,,,OR
Cottage living in Snowdonia,"Had a long if great run into North Wales from the flat plains of East Anglia, traveling with our own venerable octogenarian, who snoozed less then my other half along the drive . We were bound for Snowdonia as guests at my cousins wedding and we had a lovely time. We took over a booking at Red Dragon of one of the smaller cottages. It was very homely and comfortable and well prepared for on our arrival complete with flowers, a bottle of wine, a pint of Milk, bread and enough tea and coffee to start our holiday. Beds were ready, towels provided. We stayed for three nights plus one extra cause it was so nice! Few things to point out, on arrival you will be given a key code to access your key to open the door. We stayed in Sygun which is essentially a two up property, typical of its era the staircase is short and steep, which is OK but if you have someone older or less able it is a bit - well step. Equally I don’t think I’d like to carry a little one upstairs to bed. There is a shared drive which you can park on – but it is first come first served. There is also verge parking but watch the road in the dark when alighting. It is pretty quiet but sleeping in the front room with the window open did wake me up early morning as a car went by. Closed the window and it was fine! TV is a bit weather dependent, but it works with plenty of satellite channels. WiFi is a £5 extra and worked most days, was hit and miss one day? Laundry is on site if you need it and they ask that you strip the beds on day of departure and leave bedding on the end of your respective beds. Iron and Ironing board is also on site near the Glamping Pods. By all accounts It’s a very nice place to stay, with a pleasant country décor to match. Everything is available in the kitchen to prepare a meal and / or breakfast. Each bedroom is en suite but no downstairs WC in Sygun, lastly the second bedroom had bunkbeds rather then a traditional bed. We would visit again but for comfort value would like to stay in the Snowdon cottage mainly for the easier staircase in our case. PS first time in Wales will post some other reviews later, good village nearby is Beddgelert and you will find some good eateries, take a rain coat and enjoy stunning vistas.",4,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,OR
Good spot for bunking down. If you want to be off the grid.,"These are great little pods that sleep two people. Me and my son stayed in one in Jul 17. Cozy, No frills, good clean communal ablutions block. washing and drying facilities.
We paid for the package with wifi, but that was non existent. It was like being on dial up. I would suppose its ok, but when you want to get updates on weather conditions etc, its not the best. I would recommend this place as a great stop for some serious hill-walking. Back to basics and located right next to a busy road. I will come back again but would ensure that i got any info updates i needed before i arrived.",4,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,OR
Great little place in an amazing location,"I stayed for one night in the pods whilst walking in the surrounding mountains and I was very impressed. We arrived fairly late to find the key to our pod hanging outside along with a post-it note with my name on it. The pod was warm, which was a great surprise and the showers/kitchen/laundry room was all perfect. Considering the amazing location the price was very acceptable and I shall definitely visit again if I'm in need of accommodation in this area. The only negative point I can make is that the mattress and pillow were slightly uncomfortable but then I am a very fussy sleeper.",4,,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,OR
Serves its purpose,"My partner and I used red dragon holidays for our planned climb up Snowdon. We stayed in one of the camping pods, ours was the one closest to the road. At first I thought this would be a problem, but actually it wasn't, it was perfectly fine! You have access to clean toilets and showers, use of a fridge, microwave, kettle and toaster in communal areas. In the pod its self there is two single beds, a kettle (ours didn't work?) plates, mugs, cutlery, hair dryer and bottle opener. The grounds are well kept, and really nice on an evening to relax. Wifi was £2 a night we stayed, it wasn't great, but it was £2 so what do you expect? Would we come back? Yes, but I would upgrade and stay in either a bigger pod, or in the cottage.",4,,,,,,,OR
Great!,"Stayed for one night, used booking.com..very easy. The pods are small, and clean, perfect for 2 people on a short stay. Surprised they were close to the road, and the parking is on the verge of the road. It wasn't a problem though at all. Inside the pod is a proper divan single bed, with under-storage. A little heater, lamp, kettle, mugs, tea and coffee. Coat hooks etc...A wallet containing 'things to do'. Outside there are communal benches and a little BBQ area. There is a covered area which has a fridge, toaster, microwave and kettle. An outside undercover wash-up area! The washrooms - 2 rooms with shower, toilet and sink and there is a seperate toilet and sink area, all lockable, clean and private. There is an area with an airer where you can put your towel to dry, and a basket of 'used' toiletries left by previous guests..genius! The whole area feels safe, and as with most 'camping' experiences most people that were staying whilst we were there were respectful of others/friendly and chatty! Wifi is available for £2/pod, recommended! We met Claire the owner and she was helpful and knowledgeable of the area, after discussing some walks and looking at our map, we decided on the waterfall walk (following the Watkin Path, 300yards from the pod). As she suggested, do call in to the Caffi Gwynant just along on the main road for homemade everything!!
We will return to these pods at some stage.. Great location and a fun way to spend the night in a beautiful location!
Thanks very much!",4,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,OR
Enjoyable stay,Stayed here for one night. The Pods were very clean and although small inside they were good for a short stay. It is close to the road but I can't say that this was noticeable from a noise perspetive in either the evening or early morning. The showers were clean and there was plenty of hot water. There are a couple of fridges and microwaves in the communal areas which are useful. Weather was good and we really enjoyed our stay.,4,,,,,,,OR
Excellent place to stay,"We stayed for a few nights through the week when visiting family. The area is beautiful & the staff were extremely helpful. We stayed in one of the glamping pods which was clean and cosy with excellent facilities. We stayed with our dog (8 months old) & he was very happy & settled during our stay. Only tiny issue we had was getting eaten by the midges which seemed to be attracted to the light outside the door at night but really that's a part of the camping experience isn't it!
Would definitely recommend, such a beautiful part of the country.",4,,,,,,,OR
Snowdon hike,"Pod was clean , bright and surprisingly roomy for two. Came with crockery, weaponry , hairdryer and kettle, tea, coffee and an umbrella! Shower rooms , lovely and clean, plenty of hot water and a power shower.
Plenty of room in fridge for everyone, free wifi in mess room with computer for guests use, helps as no signal for phones - which was superb.
300yards from Watkins route to Snowdon - came down this way - not for the feint hearted. Bus stop 5 mins walk , great for the Snowdon bus ( stops off at every path) and cheap.
Look out over river and sheep
Will defiantly go back",4,,3.0,,,4.0,4.0,OR
Perfect stop for climbing Snowdon,"We stayed in one of the camping nights for one night, before climbing Snowdon the next day.
The pods were very cosy and had everything we needed, with great facilities!
Probably wouldn't stay for an extended period time (just due to lack of space) but it was ideal for a stopover and we both had a good nights sleep before the climb.
Brilliant value!",4,5.0,4.0,,,,4.0,OR
Great spot to spend a night,This accommodation is best suited to younger people or hikers requiring over night accommodation. The facilities are very good. Everything is neat and very clean. Bedding can be requested at an additional cost. Parking is on the verge. This is not far from Beddgellert where there are great restaurants.,4,,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,OR
Ideal place for exploring snowdonia,We stayed here for one night sat 13th and the pod we booked was really comfy with proper single beds! It was snug and warm and very clean. the wash block was equally as good with good showers. My only criticism would be that the kitchen hut would not be big enough if all the pods were being used and a small cooker would be ideal. We took a small gas stove which was a good thing as we didn't Find the second combi/microwave in the outside washing up area until after we had eaten! But everything else had been thoughtfully catered for. Even though it is situated on the roadside it was so quiet in the evening and we got a good nights sleep after a long walk up the Watkin path to snowdonia then a few drinks at the pub and returning for homemade chilli and a couple of bottles of wine!! Would definitely come again!,4,5.0,4.0,,,,5.0,OR
Glamp in the serenity of the woodlands without the fuss!,"These fab little pods are such a cool alternative, ideal for anyone who loves the idea of camping in the great outdoors, but not the wiping your bottom on a leaf part! They are heated, have electricity, wifi (extra £2 charge), have 2 very comfortable beds, (always a better alternative to grass), and also basic cutlery and dishes. A kitchenette, (microwave/fridge) and bathroom/toilet are just a few yards away. They have lights and are heated so you wont have to worry if your sharing a shower with a big spider!
The only downside I found was that they are about 3miles away from the 'local' pub/restaurant in Beddgelert and the only taxi that will pick up charges £20 one way. This is in no way the campsites fault, but if you fancy a drink and late night nibbles...make sure you bring your own booze & food. However, there is a local cafe about 300yards down the road that does food and drinks until about 5pm.
Staff were all friendly and helpful and I cant wait to stay again. Thank you x",4,,3.0,5.0,,5.0,,OR
Short Break to climb Snowdon,"We stayed at the camping pods from April 20th until the 22nd. We chose this site based upon its proximity to Snowdon and the walking paths. We went up the Pyg track which is only a 10 min drive, there are nearer tracks you can go up from this site and some are easily within walking distance, if you don't want to take your car there is a bus stop right outside too.
The site doesn't have dedicated parking but there is a bit of a pull in come lay by which is sufficent to clear your car of the road which is only a very quiet one anyway, there was probably less than 10 cars an hour.
The pods were all ready for our arrival and the communication throughout the booking process was great. The pods were clean and warm and had 2 single beds, tea + coffee making, plug sockets and lighting. They are basic but a step up from having to pitch your tent up if your unsure of the weather.
The site facilities include small kitchen with fridge, kettle, toaster and microwave and is sufficient for what you need. The shower are toilet area is lovely, far superior to what I expected and what I have had at much larger and expensive sites. Really clean, bright, warm and the shower was Hot and powerful!.
During our stay, the radiators were on 24/7 and as I ended up with drenced footwear on our first day it was handy to hang my trainers on the radiator to dry overnight.
I would recommend this site for a short stay, couple of local pubs 5 mins away, everywhere seemed dog friendly. Many thanks!",4,,4.0,4.0,,,,OR
Glan Dinas,"We stayed in Glan Dinas for 3 nights. We pre-ordered our groceries from Tesco on line and they were waiting for us when we arrived. The dairy items had been put away in the fridge - thanks to Red Dragon staff for that. The accommodation was excellent and ideal for visiting the Snowdon area. It was a pleasure to arrive back after a day's walking as it was comfortable and homely. On one occasion we were damp and cold and it was a delight to be able to light a log fire to warm us up. It is good that dogs are accepted, it makes a real difference. . I don't think I have ever stayed in self catering accommodation that is so well equipped. Glan Dinas has a view of the lake from each bedroom and a pleasant garden. Highly recommended.",4,,,,5.0,,5.0,OR
Maple log Cabin,"Just returned home from 5 days in the log cabin! Where to start.. As mentioned before, bread/milk etc on arrival was welcomed and appreciated. It has all you could need for a small cabin, short break. Really clean and tidy. Lovely fluffy pillows and duvet were lovely and the hot water bottles were well used by me! It had a ps2, games, and a few dvd's. Also freeview (not that we stayed in the cabin much)
A great variety of cooking utensils, saucepans, washing up liquid etc. Also knives and chopping boards etc. Clean towels and tea towels also!
The two girls absolutely loved sleeping up in the roof, via a ladder. Our youngest didn't ever want to leave!
Will love to return and upgrade to the biggest cottage. Had a little look around... STUNNING!
The only one thing as a family we needed more of was storage, however, it didn't spoil our stay in anyway!
It seems that whatever you need is available if you just ask. We didn't need anything!",4,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,,OR
Dies as it says in the tin,"My husband and I stayed here for one night. Pods were comfortable and warm on arrival. Good information packs provided by the Owners.
There are 2 showers in total, 1 of which was out of order (we weren't affected by this and at no point had to wait for the shower).
Although again we were not affected, the parking could be an issue as you have to park on the roadside verge. Being so close to the road you can hear the traffic but again not enough in my opinion for it to become an issue.
Covers all basic needs and is an ideal location for accessing Snowdon.
We would definitely stay again.",4,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,OR
Glamping! The glamorous way to go camping,"A friend and myself wanted to go and see the beautiful Mount Snowden in Wales. We decided that we wanted a nearby, inexpensive and cosy place to crash for the night as we had first planned a waterfall walk in the Brecon Beacons on our way to Mount Snowden that day.

I didn't really expect what we were about to drive into but after a long long walk around the Brecon Beacons I must say we were pleasantly surprised on our arrival at these lovely ''glamping'' pods. Firstly the pods are situated along a road but the road was in such a remote area of Wales that you would only maybe have one or two cars drive by every hour or so - and at night I didn't even notice any at all. The pods themselves are small, clean, cosy and warm and come with complimentary teas, coffee, biscuits and a tiny heater that is perfect for keeping you warm at night. There are two single beds, quite stiff mattresses with lovely soft pillows and duvet covers.
There are also two bathrooms with showers in a single separate facility within 5 metres of the pods. There is a communal area too however as we arrived quite late we didn't end up using it. The only thing I can fault here is that if you arrive late the service is limited from the vendors and we couldn't get things like clean towels or an extra pillow, etc. but you can request these extras before you arrive. Other than that perfect and what a great idea!
We weren't able to hike up Mount Snowden that weekend as I had twisted my ankle clambering up a waterfall in the Brecon Beacons but I will be going back and and will certainly be booking these lovely camping pods again.",4,5.0,4.0,,5.0,,,OR
Location is a winner,"If you are looking for a bed for a few nights on a trekking holiday then I would definitely recommend Bryn Dinas. The location is perfect for hiking up Mount Snowdon, and various other activities in the area. Bryn Dinas is located very close to the 'Watkin path' up Snowdon, which at first we thought was great, however be warned..upon further investigation we found that Watkin path is a pretty dangerous route, so make sure you do your research! We walked the Pyg Track which is still within short driving distance. Some beautiful views, the location really is the winner for this place. If you are scared of being far away from civilization, you will be pleased to know that not too far away about 20-30 mins drive there is a small town with Tesco and other little shops and restaurants. We stopped off at a very tasty fish and chip shop. The pods are nice and cosy; the heater, electric supply, kettle and lights are very useful. Each pod comes with pots and cutlery, and a few other bits like coffee, tea and milk pots. There are some basic services including microwave, fridge, toaster, kitchen sink, and laundry facilities. The bathroom facilities were not too great, the water was warm (as long as nobody else turned a tap on) however I didn't feel like they were very clean. If you are looking for basic, budget place to stay and won't be spending long at the camp, then these are ideal. I recommend taking your own sleeping bags and towels. Thank you Bryn Dinas for our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful when booking and upon arrival. For my first stay in a camping pod and not knowing what to expect, I can say it was a pleasant stay, it was exciting and fun, but I don't think I could stay longer than a few days, I missed the luxuries too much!",4,4.0,3.0,,,2.0,,OR
Great base for exploring Snowdonia!,"I stayed in one of the camping pods for 3 nights as a base for exploring and climbing Snowdon.
Our arrival was a smooth process and constant contact with the owner had ensured we had all the info we needed. We arrived with our own food (nearest supermarket is 9 miles away) and set up base. The pods are surprisingly roomy for two people, bed linen, kettle and kitchenette area were all clean as were the shower block.
The village of Beddgelert was lovely, a few nice places to eat in the evening, not too far a drive back either.
All in all it was a great place to stay on a budget to explore the local surroundings. We will definitely stay here if visiting the area again!",4,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,OR
Staying at the Red Dragon site.,"A fab stay at the Red Dragon pod, Harlech castle. Claire was extremely pleasant and very helpful. We had all the facilities we needed.

Chilled week,"Stayed in Maple Lodge cabin. Very lucky with the weather - it was beautiful. A small but cosy cabin. TV available. Double bed and two singles in roof area. We didn't use the roof bedroom area.
Claire, the owner, is one of the most helpful accommodation owners I have ever met. What a star ! Next time I think would like to stay in one of the stone cottages. Would love to stay there again. The pods looked like fun !
Great amenities - wifi £10 for week. Iron , ironing board Washing machine available. Microwave on site. No mobile phone signal. However, pay phone on site.
Thank you Claire for all your help - it was very much appreciated.",4,,,,,,,OR
Great location and value for money,Very clean site with great facilities. We stayed for 2 nights and our sole purpose for visiting was to walk to the summit of Mount Snowdon. The pods were in a great location for starting the Watkins Walk up to Mount Snowdon. We also visited Porthmadog as it wasn't very far away. Would definitely stay again - one thing to watch out for is the midges. There was a lot about and it made sitting outside very difficult.,4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,OR

"Small, simple, wonderful","Stayed in Maple Lodge, June 2014. Three adults stayed - 2 in the loft, plus one dog. We were greeted with a welcome pack including milk, bread and a bottle of red wine. Claire had e- mailed us all the details we needed plus to let us know where the key would be to let us into the cabin! During the stay there was absolutely no pressure from anyone which made it a relaxing and quiet break for us. Other guests were in the pods and main house but all felt private and 'easy' . Bedgellert had pubs and cafés, shops and tourist information. We walked up the Watkins path which was fantastic and especially so only being minutes from the lodge. Would love to return as I know the lodge is a comfortable place to stay with all the basics you need, plus more to do than I'd given it time for!",4,,,,,,,OR
Great facilities & location,"Whilst it's not exactly 'glamping', Red Dragon have good facilities in a great location at a bargain price. The pods are perfect for a few nights stay, were warm and clean and well set up.

Great time glamping at Red Dragon...,"We only found the camping pods at Red Dragon upon driving past whilst looking for a B&B that night. Claire was more than accommodating and prepared out pod within 30 minutes of us phoning. Glad we found it - was great fun, pods lovely and warm and very clean, nice to come back to a cup of tea too and had a goods night sleep! Shared toilet and shower facilities were very clean. Handy pack of information in the pod too.
Being someone who like their luxuries this is more 'glamping' than camping - I loved it! We are already planning our next visit later in the year.",4,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,OR
Great value,"We spent 1 night in a pod as a base to head up the Watkin Path. We were given a warm & helpful welcome, being quickly shown where all of the amenities were (this takes 2 mins as the site is tiny), before depositing our gear in our pod (Beaumaris). The pod itself was clean, warm & comfortable and, at £36 per night, considerably better value than many local B&Bs. Unlike some other pod designs, there is ample standing room and the beds are ""real"" beds.
As advertised, access to the Watkin Path up Snowdon is 5 mins walk away & the site itself is very easy to find, being right on the main road from Betws y Coed to Beddgelert. The availability of a tumble dryer (£1) was most welcome (if you've ever tried to climb Snowdon in October you may understand why).
We, having failed in our Snowdon objective, decided to walk to Beddgelert for a pint & a bite to eat. Buses are few & far between at this time of year. The walk is pleasant & takes about 45 mins but, as you'd expect on country lanes, it's important to be aware of traffic, especially if returning after dark as we did (take a torch).",4,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,OR
Tryfan Cottage,"We had a lovely stay at Tryfan Cottage at the end of June. The cottage was lovely and cosy and provided plenty of accommodation for the four of us (all adults). After a long hike, the hot water, comfy sofa's and delightful bed was just what was needed.
We were pleasantly surprised by our little welcome gifts after a long drive to Snowdonia (we won't spoil the surprise).
We would highly recommend this accommodation for Snowdonia and fulfilling our childhood wishes to see Gelert's grave. There is also plenty of places to eat/drink close by in Beddgelert.",4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,OR
Glamping in the mountains,"These camping pods are ideal if you are not too keen on hard core camping. The pod has 2 single beds, and plates and cups are provided. Although you can also drive into the village for pub food.
The location is quite handy if you want to go up Snowdon.
There are two showers to share and the these are good showers. I do love a good pressured shower to get my day started!!
You can also pay for bedding or use your own sleeping bag and pay less. Prices are really reasonable! There is a communal area, outside seating, kitchen if you wish to cook. Everything you need really. Also lots of information on things to do is provided and dogs are allowed.
Claire is also very nice and helpful when booking.",4,,,,,,,OR
Very poor owner's attitude,"We had to endure one night of the pod door swinging open and banging in the stormy night, so I think it would have been reasonable to get a discount, even £10, even though it was fixed the next day, we still had to endure that night. We had a great holiday, so don't let this stop you booking. You probably won't have to deal with the owner. The staff were lovely, and helpful. Nice bathroom, shared with one other pod, a shared kitchen sink with washing up stuff provided. Could have done with more hooks and shelves, and a bedside cabinet with storage space underneath, and pillow cases that fitted the pillows, and a bed where both the sliding doors slid, and a kinder more polite attitude when dealing with complaints.",3,,2.0,,3.0,5.0,,OR
Disappointed,"When I booked the log cabin it looked to be separate from other pods with a fair bit of space around it. However it wasn't the case. They have put more pods there and a reception shed since photo was taken. It was very close to the road and parking was on the roadside so in peak season be aware that Snowdon hikers will be parking there as well.
The bathroom was not cleaned very well, blood under the toilet seat and on the woodwork. Dirt in the glasses in the cupboard.
The pod needs rearranging again to have the couch facing the TV as it wasn't comfortable. We went out from 7am to 5pm hiking and walking around and watching the TV on return with a beer wasn't great. No I don't go away to watch TV but its nice to relax after 10 mile walk.
Shame there is no where within the site to let dog go to toilet. However it's just a walk out to the roadside.
Can't comment on staff as we saw none.
Apart from the road it is nicely located.
Beddgelert was OK. Not tourist or dog friendly bar pizza place and Saracens. Either places didn't accept dogs or they weren't doing food because of covid and they had no chefs.
All in all I was disappointed at the cost of the log cabin.",3,,,,,,,OR
Average,"Our stay at the cottages was average. The cottage was lovely and there was everything that we needed and more. They have left us with tea coffee milk and bread. There were some disappointments. The bathroom wasn't as clean and smelt of damp. It could probably do with a revamp. The shower in the ensuite was broken and so it couldn't be used. They had left rotting flowers in the kitchen set the tone for the start of the holiday. The cottage could also do with a more up to date TV. It did remind us being back in the 00s.
The rest of the cottage was clean and we enjoyed our stay overall.",3,,,,,,,OR
Weekend stay,"I booked this stay as a Christmas present for my boyfriend as we were also visiting bounce below.
This site is in a great location, opposite the local sheep and a large lake you can walk around as well as a short walk away from an unique little cafe. The views near by were spectacular!
There states to be two kitchens at this site however one of which was not appealing, with there being no door and being very small it didn't look very safe.
As well as this I believe the bathrooms could be improved by fully parting them as they are currently open at the top which I felt wasn't private enough.
This being said overall it's a perfect place to lay your head for a few nights while adventuring!",3,,,,,,,OR
Pods,"just returned from a 4 night stay - what a beautiful location! Centrally located between Llanberis (30 mins) and Porthmadog (30 mins) it is an ideal base for exploring the area. The pods were small but clean, well equipped and comfortable. The showers and kitchen/laundry facilities are close by, and also clean and well equipped. The only drawback we found was that the pods are really close together, ideal if you have a large group (up to ten), but not really for people travelling separately. Also, close to the main road, but couldn't really say that we heard much noise. Luckily, we had a good group of people to share the evenings with. We would definitely use this site again, but maybe for one or two nights rather than 4.",3,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,OR

Meh,"Didn’t receive a confirmation email so had to search around for our key
No outside lights so 5PM in winter is pitch black looking for said keys
Surname was wrote wrong on leaflet left with keys
Requested beds pushed together but didn’t happen
Was told there was no bedding or pillows, took our own, but then there was
Pod next door to us didnt have bedding so they took ours
Only us and 1 other couple there but they stuck us right next to each other... the pods aren’t sound proof!!
Pods are a 10mins drive from Beddgelert, nearest taxi company will charge £30 to take you into Beddgelert
Went to make a cup of tea in the morning and the tea bags had Mold on them
Very small pods!",2,,,,,,,OR
"No staff, broken beds, slightly confusing experience.","Arrived to find our key hung on our pod and a post it note on the door with my name on it. No staff were available to speak to or greet us. On entering the pod, it was warm and clean. There were 2 single beds, a table with a lamp, kettle, cups and coffee/tea/sugar/milk. There was a small but adequate heater installed and a main light above the door. The beds dipped a lot in the middle and made loud noises from even the slightest movement. They appear to be low quality or children's beds. Certainly not a quality that is suitable for heavy use as would be expected. Unfortunately this made for a poor night sleep. We went out for a meal and returned at about 6pm and there were still no staff to be seen. The toilet and shower block is nice and had plenty of hot water. It was also sufficiently clean. The scenery and views are outstanding. It would take a lot to beat the views. After a rough nights sleep, we woke at about 7am and decided to wash and left at about 8am. We did have another look for staff before we left but still no sign of anybody.
It is right next to a road but very little traffic so this is no problem at all.",2,,,,,,,OR
The smallest pod in the world,"Despite being on a road our initial thoughts were ""How Sweet!"" Then on closer inspection we noticed that the pod was actually quite dirty inside. There were well established spiders inside the eaves, the bedding was bobbly and the mugs plus spoons were dirty. The carpet runner had seen better days. The lights are left on site all night, there are no blackout blinds so it is like sleeping with the lights on. Insect repellent blinds would also be of benefit as when the sun goes down the midges come out (this is normal and not a criticism of the site). One of the two mattresses was very uncomfortable. I am happy without but I bought WiFi for my son and it was non-existant in the room, he didn't feel comfortable using it in the Common Room away from the pod as a group of men staying adjacent to this room had commandeered the area. All of this was bearable but the real problem was just how dirty the bathroom facilities were. I have been camping in more remote sites and the facilities have always been much better than this. One of the cold taps had black slime growing around it. The corners of the washroom facilities were unclean. There was no hot water coming out of the tap in the kitchen. Sitting outside you occasionally get an aroma of sewage. We did not complain whilst we there as only staying 2 nights seemed pointless, it would need a deep clean to get I back on par.
Parking is on a verge outside the pods and although I had reservations about this there is no problem. The road is fairly quiet overnight so this does not interfere with the ambience. We only encountered one member of staff and she was very nice. The location was brilliant as only 10 minutes away from Pen-y-pass car park hence our reason for staying being to climb Snowdon. There was no need to cook as there is an array of eateries in Beddegelert about 3 minutes down the road. There is a lovely view from the site. There is also heating in the pod which we didn't need whilst we were there but it is working. Bryn Dinas didn't ruin Snowdonia for us as it so beautiful but it could have been so much better.

Absolutely Awful do not recommend,"This site states that these glamping pods are 'dog friendly '. These are not dog friendly at all , you have a main road less than 20m away from your pod with a poxy gate that wouldn't stop any child or dog running through. There is about 5 inches space for you to stand up and move around in your pod and the mattresses are awful. They smell sweaty and unclean. You have to cook outside despite if kts raining with no cover and there is no drying room. Weird for somewhere when it's going to expect alot of walkers/ hikers. When I had approached Antony about the situation and explained we were unhappy and that my lurchers did not feel welcomed by guests I had a reply of "" sorry the weather changed your mind"" despite the fact it did not and he refused to give me any refund. DO NOT GO TO THESE PODS.
They were that awful we left early and told the new couple arriving not to stay aswell.",1,,,,,,,OR
The smallest pod in the world,"This is the smallest pod I have ever stayed in there is about 3 inches from the bed to the door. Not the best when you have two adults and two dogs. When we arrived it was freezing! There is no drying room. It's a tumble dryer. Don't expect to sleep if like me your a light sleeper it's not sound proof.
Parking is on the road not dog or visitor friendly with cars driving past at all hours.
The shower and toilets block were freezing esp the toilet seat. The shower it's self was ok. Not the cleanest but manageable.
Really not worth the money when you can get a travelodge for the same price or cheaper that's not to far away. I know it's bad as my husband was complaining and he will quite happily sleep outside in a bivie.",1,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,,OR
Audrey White,"We have stayed in a variety of holiday accommodation over the years, this was the most disappointing. On arrival we were met with an overwhelming smell of dampness and ""wet dog"". We had to search for the bed linen for use on the sofa bed and the television/sky box was unconnected and took my husband over an hour to reconnect. The sofa bed and flooring were covered in animal hair, thankfully we do not suffer from any allergies. Our mattress was extremely lumpy, the duvet and pillows smelt also of damp. Only one set of drawers, which were shabby and dirty inside. There was a faded plastic table and chairs to one corner of the outside area that certainly didn't look welcoming and had seen better days.
We left the cottage a day early due to our disappointment and discomfort. We emailed Red Dragon with our comments and have not received any response.
Generally a neglected cottage that has the potential to be cosy with a little investment (replace mattress, bed linen, sofa bed) and regular cleaning.
Optimistic to fit four in this cottage.
